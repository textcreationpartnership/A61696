            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Enſuing Treatiſe which I am bold to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Your wiſedomes view, containes principall politicall reaſons grounded upon the Lawes of this Kingdom, for the remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the preſent Hierarchie, and planting of a Governement by Paſtors and Elders. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of Lay Elders hath beene very diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to many; whereas the Elder intended to be planted, is not lay, but in regard of the ſervice (wherein hee is to bee imployed) Eccleſiaſticall. The Author was an elaborate Student in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Law, and a profeſſor of it. He was eſteemed
<pb facs="tcp:102527:3"/> learned by the beſt of that profeſsion, as alſo by Divines and common Lawyers, learned Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cook,</hi> late Chiefe Juſtice of the Kings Bench, Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Yelverton,</hi> late Judge of the Common Pleas, Sir <hi>Henry Finch,</hi> late the Kings Serjeant at Law, and others have given teſtimony of him. The Treatiſe is an anſwer to diverſe paſſages in a Book written by D. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> late Archb. of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> intituled An admonition to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> The Author (as I doubt not but will appeare to your Wiſedomes) hath written with the ſpirit of meekeneſſe and humility, ſubmitting all to the judgement of an High Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> hee diſputes with the Great Biſhop in a Scholaſticall way, without one ſyllable of reviling, or bitter language, which he ever deteſted. Hee diſcovers the foundation of the Hierarchie to be totally ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and to bee aboliſhed by the abolition of the Papall Canon Law, which appeares to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the ſtatute of 25. of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. The truth whereof (being diſcovered by the Authors means to the ſaid learned Judge Sir <hi>Edward Cooke,)</hi> hee did moſt ingenuouſly acknowledge, and did avow he never underſtood the ſtatute ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet affirmed he thought he had read the ſaid ſtatute an hundred times. May it pleaſe you in your wiſedomes to commend the Treatiſe to bee viewed by the learned Gent. of the long Robe,
<pb facs="tcp:102527:3"/> whoſe awfull judgments I ſhall ever honour. Moſt true it is (I dare averre) there is little written in this Kingdome tending to the removall of the <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> from Legall and Politicall arguments, but the Author hath the arrowes in his quiver, I ſay not that others have borrowed light from his Candle. Right Honourable and Right worthy, I ſhall humbly take further boldnes (humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming upon your Honourable favours) if this poore model find acceptance in your ſight, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you with a new impreſsion of an abſtract written in time of famous Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (a Book well knowne to learned King <hi>Iames)</hi> by the ſame Author, whoſe memory, I am bound by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Honour. Give mee leave onely now to make knowne unto you the Title and ſeverall Treatiſes contained in it. It is intituled, An ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of certaine Laws, Canons and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Synodall and Provinciall in force within the Queenes dominions, and for the moſt part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the ſubject. It containeth theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Treatiſes. 1. That a learned Miniſtery is commanded by Law. 2. That Pluralities are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by Law. 3. That it is unlawfull to make a Miniſter without a title. 4. That it is unlawfull for a Clerk to have civill authority. This abſtract was ſeemingly anſwered by the rayling ſtile of a then Doctor <hi>Cozens,</hi> but by a further incounter,
<pb facs="tcp:102527:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> and the counterpoyſon (yet extant) written by the ſame Author, he departed the Field with Honour, ſuch was the opinion of many learned, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the foreſaid, Reverend Judge, Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton.</hi> This treatiſe was never queſtioned nor quarreld, for ought I ever heard: Yet was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor well knowne to many of the Biſhops. You may happily in your Wiſdomes conceive ſome things might have beene omitted, as not wholly incident to the time, and ſome abbreviated in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſhortneſſe of your time, and of the high affaires now in hand. But may it pleaſe you, being about ſo to doe, I found the light muſt have bin much Eclipſed, and the truth obſcured. I am over bold, moſt humbly to commend the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of what he writes, grounded upon the laws of the Kingdome, to your moſt Honourable prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It ſhall be enough for me to attend among the meaneſt of your ſervants, having heretofore had the happineſſe to have bin a member (though unworthy) of the Honourable Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>

                  <p>This platforme of government, intended by the admonitor, not to be liked of in this place, is that platforme of Church government, <note place="margin">Booke of Com. Pray. tit.

From whence it followeth that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Suffraganes, Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Deacons, Chancellours, Commiſſaries and Officialls, now alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy planted and liked of, was not practiſed by the Apoſtles and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. And therefore for my part, I cannot, but marvell, that a diſciple of the Apoſtles Doctrine, and a ſucceſſor in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Chaire, ſhould be drawne to humane reaſons, not to like of the Apoſtles government, nor to tread in the ſteps of the Primitive Church. For ſeeing the ſame is acknowledged by himſelf to be the firſt ways to be the old and ancient way, as being the Apoſtles way, why <note place="margin">Ier. 6. 16.</note> ſhould we not walke therein, as in the only good and perfect way? The reverend Biſhops will not deny, that the Apoſtles, and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church for their manner of governement, had the mind of Chriſt,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102527:9"/> and that we ſhould follow the Apoſtles, as having them for examples, becauſe they were the followers of Chriſt. Againe they cannot but grant, that the manner of governement, practiſed by the Apoſtles and Primitive Church, is written within the booke of the covenants of grace. All which notwithſtanding we ſee in this place, that from the new Teſtament, from the Articles of grace, from the law, from the teſtimonie, from the example of the Apoſtles, and from the mind of Chriſt, we are addreſſed and turned over to our ſtate of government, to our countrey, to our people, to our Common weale, and to our Lawes. But this turning of deviſes ſhall it not bee eſteemed, as the Potters clay? <note place="margin">Iſa. 29. 16.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (ſaith he) to plant thoſe things in this Church, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be redreſſed, might bring rather the overthrow of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, than the end, that is deſired. Indeed (ſay I) if this might be as ſoone proved, as it was ſoone ſaid, the caſe might have gone well with him. But this parable is ſo darke, that (unleſſe it be opened) there is no light at all to be ſeene in it. For he well knew, that in ſtead of the government practiſed by the Apoſtles and Primitive Church, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Suffragans, Deacons, Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Chancellors, Commiſſaries, and Officials, is already planted in this Church; And he was not ignorant alſo that the ſame juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only, and none other, is required to be redreſſed. Now then if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt be made, that this manner of governement be redreſſed, how can it evidently bee ſeene that to plant that manner of government, might bring rather the overthrow of the Goſpell than the end that is deſired? But it may be that he meant more lightſomely than he ſpake. Yea let it be, that he intended thus: <hi>viz.</hi> to unplant that, which is now planted, and to plant thoſe things, which are yet unplanted (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of many and great alterations) might bring rather an overthrow of the Goſpell, than the end that is deſired; well (I ſay) be it ſo, that he thus meant. How is this thing evidently ſeene, or how can it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be proved? The beſt ſight, that the ſervant of Chriſt can have, is faith. For Faith is an evidence of things which are not ſeene. This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> then of the Goſpell, not being ſeene with his bodily eyes, muſt needs be intended to have beene ſeene with the eyes of his faith, But where is the word of Chriſt, whereupon the eyes of his faith were fixed? If then he hold no word of faith, then of neceſſitie was his evident ſight, but an evident fancy. And in deed what elſe could it be? For what other thing is there deſired, to bee planted in this Church, but only the Apoſtolicall government of Chriſt? And what
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102527:10"/> other Goſpell could hee evidently ſee, that might bee overthrowne by holding forth this ſcepter, but only the Apoſtolicall doctrine of Chriſt? A marvellous ſtrange and unkinde ſight, (I trow) to be ſeene, that the Apoſtolicall Governement could no ſooner bee planted, but that the Apoſtolicall doctrine muſt needs be rooted up. That Chriſt by his owne ſcepter, were not able to maintaine his owne grace, by his owne order, ſhould weaken his owne oath, or by his owne ſword, ſhould cut from the people of God, his owne Word. But ſeeing it was his purpoſe to perſwade the people unto a diſlike of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall government, by arguments and reaſons drawne from humane po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, rather than to confirme them in a good opinion of the Prelaticall Government, by proofes taken from the authoritie of holy Scripture, we will follow him in this his veine. Yea, and by the help of God, we will try of what efficacy, ſuch his politike and humane reaſons may be, as wherewith he did aſſay, to diſſwade the people from conſenting unto any other manner of Church Government, than is already ſetled among us. The generall effect of all which, both here and elſe where ſpoken of, by him briefly gathered, is this:</p>

                  <p>If any ſhall object that by thus gathering his argument, I had in this place falſified his argument, by adding more, than is here expreſly ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by him: let ſuch one underſtand, that this charge is but a meere and needleſſe cavill. For ſithence both here, and throughout his booke, his intent was to diſpute for the governement already received, againſt the governement, which is required, to bee planted, in the Church:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102527:10"/> And for ſo much alſo, as none other governement, is required to bee planted, but that only Government, which was practiſed, by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Primitive Church, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes which he ſhot againſt the government required to bee planted, were ſhot only againſt the governement which was practiſed by the Apoſtles, and the Primitive Church. And therefore there can be no juſt charge of any falſification; uſed in the gathering of his arguments. Againſt which I argue as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The truth of which argument will then appeare, when the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors argument ſhall be convinced of errour: for the diſproofe of the one, is the proofe of the other, and if his fall, then cannot this but follow. And touching the invaliditie of the firſt propoſition, of his ſecond Sillogiſme, we affirme, that the alterations, of the ſtate of government, and of the Lawes (bee they never ſo many and never ſo great) can never bring any overthrow of the Goſpell, if the ſame alterations, be made, for the planting of the Goſpell. For the lawes once altered, can overthrow nought, becauſe they are then no more lawes. And to ſay, that the Goſpell once planted by authoritie of new lawes, can be overthrowne by the ſame lawes, is more abſurd. For the new lawes give life to the entertaining of the Goſpell, by means wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Goſpell, can not diſcontinue, ſo long as thoſe lawes continue. And hereupon alſo it followeth, that no alteration of lawes, for ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cleanſing of the Church, for caſting, and whipping buyers and ſellers, and choppers of Churches, out of the Church, can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Goſpell. For if all droſſe, filth, and corruption, be caſt out; if all lets, and impediments, be done away, it cannot be but that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, muſt needs have a freer, and larger paſſage, as whereunto a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der doore can not bee, but opened, for the bringing in of a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102527:11"/> more plentifull harveſt. And if the Church be beautifull as <hi>Tyrſa,</hi> and <note place="margin">Sol. ſong. 6. 3, 4</note> comely as <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> if ſhe looke as the morning, If ſhe be faire as the Moone, pure as the Sunne, and terrible as an army, then is ſhe ſet as a ſeale on the Lords heart, and as a ſignet upon his arme, and then ſhall the coales of his jealouſie be as fiery coales, and as a vehement ſlame, that much water ſhall never quench it, nor any floods ever drowne it. But if he ſhould rather meane, that the alterations of the ſtate of governement, ſhould be ſo many and ſo great, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he did ſtrongly imagine, evidently to ſee the overthrow of the Goſpell, then we ſay that no ſtate of government, can ever undergo, either many, or few, either ſmall, or great alterations, unleſſe by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of lawes made by the ſame ſtate of Government, the ſame ſtate of government be altered. Now then if our politike ſtate of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (whereof hee muſt needs ſpeake, for otherwiſe his ſpeech were to no purpoſe) to amend and reforme abuſes in it ſelfe, may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put it ſelfe under the yoke of a new law, (as it hath done, and daily doth unto many new lawes) and ſo in this reſpect, after a ſort, in ſome part alter it ſelfe (for every reformation is a kinde of alteration) without any dammage, hazard, or prejudice to it ſelf, if (I ſay) this may well be ſo, what a ſilly skare-crow, is there here, brought into the field, to fray our politike ſtate of governement, for attempting a reformation in the Church? Belike he knew ſome to faine, that our ſtate of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, muſt neceſſarily fancy whatſoever they fancy. And name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a reformation of the Church, cannot but inferre a deſolation of the State: or that the State cannot be well ordered except it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Church to be diſordered: or that the Church could not be faire, well favoured, and in good plight, but the ſtate of our Countrey, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and common weale, muſt be foule, ill favoured and out of heart; or laſtly that the State cannot launce, binde, draw, and heale up the ſores, wounds, and contagions of the Church, but it muſt withall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, infect and poiſon it ſelfe. All which, how unſavorie and voide of all ſenſe it is, I leave to the judgement, both of the ſtate, and of the Church. For who ſeeth not, but that the ſtate of politike government, may wholly alter the ſtate of Church government, and not ſo much as alter one leaſt jot of the politike ſtate of government it ſelfe? Beſides, ſince our ſtate of politike government, hath in our dayes and before our eyes, repealed very many old lawes, and diſavowed ſundry ancient cuſtomes, to entertaine, and harbour the Goſpell, muſt our ſtate of politike government, no ſooner now attempt to repaire certaine breaches, made into the vineyard, but it muſt ſtreight wayes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102527:11"/> roote up, that which it hath planted, and pull downe that, which it hath builded? Hee that diggeth about, and dungeth, hee that ſpreadeth and pruneth the rootes and branches of a Tree, doth hee not rather quicken, than kill the roote? And doth hee not rather cauſe the boughes to ſprought, than the body to wither? Can ſeven times trying, and fining of Gold, breed a canker in Gold: or may a River bee dreined drie, by one who ſhutteth not, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth the Springs? The bodie of a corpulent, and diſeaſed man, the more it is purged, the more full of health it is, and of better conſtitution. And how then can it be concluded, that the Goſpell, the life and ſoule of the Church, can languiſh, and give up the ghoſt, when the Church for the better preſervation of her health, ſhall receive by ſome new and wholeſome law, ſome new and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome purgative receite? Moreover, forſomuch as here is mention made, how the publiſhers of this Booke, did conſider on the one part, of things that were required to bee redreſſed, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, of things required to bee planted, together with the ſtate of our Countrey, People, and Common weale, it is plaine, that their reſolution was rather ſtill to continue things amiſſe, in the Church unredreſſed, than to plant the things required, to be planted. And alas, what a reſolution was that among pillars and Fathers (for ſo they will bee counted) of the Church? Eſpecially, when as the things required to be redreſſed, were required to bee redreſſed at the hands of the whole ſtate of governement, that is, at the hands of the Queene, the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and Commons in open Parliament aſſembled. And could any dammage (I pray you) have enſued to the ſtate of Government, to the ſtate of the Queene, to the ſtate of our Countrey, People, Common weale, and Lawes, or to the ſtate of the Goſpell, if things amiſſe in the Church, had beene redreſſed, and things wanting in the Church, had beene planted by ſo high, and ſupreme a power? I trow not. Nay ſeeing our Countrey, People, and Commmon weale, not only once, and twice, and thrice, but many times, have humbly and earneſtly prayed, and ſolicited in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Parliament, a redreſſe of things amiſſe in the Church, is it not moſt evident, that things were not conſidered aright but amiſſe by theſe Fathers of the Church? And that the conſiderers by keeping things unplanted, rather aymed at their owne profit, honour, and dignitie, than that our Countrey, People, and Common weale, ſhould fare the better, by having things amiſſe, to bee redreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The conſiderers then being them ſelves parties, yea and ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102527:12"/> as by whom things were carried amiſſe, in the Church, and whoſe defects only were required to be redreſſed: no marvell (I ſay) if they uſed all kinde of artificiall adviſement and conſideration, to keepe things ſtill unplanted, by the planting whereof their owne unfather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſcariages, muſt have beene reformed.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, if things required to be planted, might indeed be once planted, howſoever happily our former Church officers, might bee ſomewhat male-contented, and diſcouraged, to have their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities pared, and the edge of their ſwords abated, yet is there no leaſt cauſe at all, for our Countrey, people, and Common weale to feare any trouble, or hurly burly among us. For if the hand of God be in Judah, ſo that he give the people one heart, to doe the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">2 Chron. 30 12.</note> of the King, and of the Rulers, according to the word of the Lord, and if the King, the Nobles and Commons ſhall condeſcend and agree in one, and if their voices ſhall be all, but as the voice of one man, to allow and approve that, which doth touch and concerne them all, then ſhall neither the Nobles have any occaſion to diſdaine the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, nor the Commons any reaſon to envie the Nobles. Much leſſe can the Nobles be at variance with the Nobles, nor the Commons be at defiance with the Commons. For they bee all of them ſo prudent, and ſo provident, as that they will not bite one another, leſt they ſhould be devoured one of the other. And in deed, why ſhould any of our Clergie-Maſters be ſo void of judgement, as to deny the Nobles and Commons, after foure and forty yeares experience, of a moſt proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous peace, waiting upon the Goſpell, to be now growne ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſpect and ſimple witted, as that a reformation of diſorders to be made by their conſents in others, ſhould bring forth a confuſion in themſelves? What? will they bicker one with the other, will they beate, and buffet one another, when there is no cauſe of diſagreement, or variance betweene them? For they ſhall be ſure to loſe neither li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, nor dignitie; they ſhall endanger neither honour, nor profit. Our Nobles ſhall be treſ-noble ſtill, they ſhall be Princes and Captaines over our people: They ſhall be Deputies and Preſidents in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Weale: They ſhall be Peeres, and Ancients of the Kingdome: their Priviledges, Prerogatives, Preeminences, ſtiles, enſignes, and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of proweſle, and honour, ſhall not be raced, defaced, or diminiſhed. But they ſhall (as they may and ought) remaine and continue whole, and inviolable, both to them, and their poſterities, throughout their generations. Our Judges, Juſtices, and Lawyers, ſhall have and enjoy their authorities, credits, and reputations, as in ancient times. They
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102527:12"/> ſhall be recorders of our Cities, Townes, and Boroughs: They ſhall be Stewards of Kings Leets and Lawdayes. Our Knights, Eſquires and Gentlemen, ſhall ſtill bee Burgeſſes in Parliaments, and Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Kings peace: they ſhall bee Aſſiſtants to examine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe thefts, rapines, murders, robberies, riots, routs, and ſuch like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies. yea they ſhall be our Spokes-men, and our Dayes-men, to arbitrate and compoſe, ſtriffes and debates betweene neighbour and neighbour. Our common people, they without diſturbance, ſhall qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly and peacably, retaine and injoy (as in former ages) their immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, franchiſes and liberties, as well abroad as at home, as well in their houſes, as in their fields. They ſhall poſſeſſe their tenancies without ejection, they ſhall bee inheritors without expulſion, as well to the lawes, liberties, and cuſtomes, as to the lands and poſſeſſions of their Anceſtors. They ſhall not bee compelled to goe to warfare upon their owne coſts, they ſhall not be tryed, arraigned, or condemned, by forraign power, or by forraigne Lawes. There ſhall no husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, no clothing, no handicraft, no mariner, no marchandiſe, no lawes of the Land, no manner of good learning whatſoever in Schoole, Colledge, or Vniverſitie, be decreaſed or laid aſide.

Nay our Nobles, and our Commons, are moſt aſſured to bee ſo farr from being endammaged, or doſing ought hereby, as hereby they ſhall purchaſe that unto themſelves, which never yet any oppugner of ſo good and holy a cauſe, could attaine unto.

                  <p>But happily it may be replyed, that ſome of our Nobles, and moſt of our ``Commons, be ſo backwardly affected of the truth of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">Pag. 79.</note> as that rather they would turne head upon the Goſpell, than <note place="margin">Pag. 79.</note> brooke an alteration of Archiepiſcopall, Epiſcopall, and Archidiaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church governement. In deed if a reformation of the ſtate of the Clergie were attempted by any other meanes, than by publike tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and conſent of Parliament, I could not but leane unto this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the attempting thereof might bring an overthrow to the attempters. Becauſe the ſame attempt, ſhould be diſhonourable to the name of God, as being contrary to the forme of doctrine recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

But let us wade a little deeper, and ſearch a little more narrowly into every veine, creeke, and corner of this ſuppoſition.

For they being evermore of every religion, and ſo indeed of no religion, and paſſing not whether our Saviour Chriſt, or Beliall be their God, ſing as the Poet ſingeth; <hi>Ais? Aio: Negas? Nego:</hi>

If the King be a Goſpeller, the Goſpel, the Goſpel, and naught elſe, but the Goſpel ſhall be found to roule in their mouthes. But let the Crowne once turne, by and by, they have turned their Coates, and as weaher-cocks, with every puffe of winde, are huffed about. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever order or manner of government bee planted or diſplanted in the Church, the ſame ſhall bee no coroſive to them. It ſhall never ſticke in theſe mens ſtomacks, neither will they lay it to their heartes. The King and the Counſell is wiſe enough, and know what they have to doe well enough. They will not bee more forward, nor wiſer than the Prince, they will not checke and controll the whole Realme. They cannot brooke theſe buſie bodies, and medlers in matters above their reach. They will bee none of theſe new fangled and preciſe fooles; they will not be backward, and come behinde the law, as the Papiſts doe; neither will they be too forward, and runne before the law, as the Puritans doe. But they will behave themſelves in all things, and at all ſeaſons, as diſcreet and politike Proteſtants ought to doe, conforming and ſubmitting themſelves alwayes to all order and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Queenes booke, and lawes ſetled. Yea and though they be not booke learned, nor any pen Clerks, yet they believe well. And therefore they will goe to the Church, and ſay a few prayers, yea, and they will receive the Sacrament at Eaſter, as devoutly as the beſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian of them all. All theſe Atheiſts and godleſſe men, being neither hot nor cold, neither fiſh nor fleſh, nor good red herring, plant what plants you will, and ſowe what ſeeds you liſt, yea make what ditch, hedge, pale, wall, or ſence you pleaſe, they ſet cocke upon hoope, and paſſe not a button for it; every ſeaſon, be it wet, or be it dry; every kind of land, be it clay, or be it ſand; every ſurrow, be it broad, or be it nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, be it deepe or be it ſhallow, pleaſeth theſe medley coates alike. They are like unto <hi>Iacobs</hi> Ewes, which having ſtraked and party co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured rods laid before them in the gutters, at a ramming time, brought forth none other but party coloured Lambes.

It is good ſleeping alwayes, for theſe men in a whole skinne: And not much unlike to theſe party coloured ſleepers, are the admonitorie proteſtants. For they, as the dutie of faithfull ſubjects doe bind them, living in a ſtate of the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and having libertie in externall government, and other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward orders to chooſe ſuch as they thinke, in wiſedome and godlineſſe, to be moſt convenient for the ſtate of their countrey, and diſpoſition of the people, and having the conſent of their godly Magiſtrates, to

For if it be too great a bridle of Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (as they ſay) in things externall, to caſt upon the Church of Chriſt, a perpetuall commandement, and if the Church have free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to make choiſe of what government ſoever, ſhe thinketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, then is ſhe neither reſtrained at her pleaſure, to forſake that which by long experience ſhe hath found to be inconvenient, neither is ſhe tyed ſtill to retaine Archiepiſcopall, Epiſcopall, and Archidiaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall governement, though for a long ſeaſon the ſame have beene uſed. For that indeed might well and juſtly be ſaid, be too to great a bridle of Chriſtian libertie, when by neceſſitie there is caſt upon the Church, ſuch a perpetuall regiment of prelacy, as may not be removed. Wherefore if our continued Prelaticall diſcipline, whereby the liberty of the Church is taken away, by publike authority of the King and States might be diſcontinued, and libertie granted to the Church, to uſe the Apoſtolicall diſcipline, either our Admonitorie Proteſtants muſt yeeld, ſtoop, and obey, or els be found to be a way ward, a contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea though they ſhould unite, linke and confederate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in one. For are they not weaker in power, poorer in purſe, and of farre leſſe reputation than the former? And yet nevertheleſſe, theſe parts are at ſuch deadly feud one againſt the other, and at ſuch an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable enmitie betweene themſelves, that the caſe ſtandeth now

                  <p>Beſides, the firſt ſort of theſe two ſorts, whom it pleaſeth our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, <note place="margin">Puritane proteſtants, can never overthrow the Goſpell.</note> the Admoniſhers, for difference ſake to dubb with the Knights Hood of Preciſians, or preciſe and puritane Proteſtants. Why? They are the onely and principall ſpokeſ-men and petitioners for the Apoſtolicall Diſcipline, required to bee planted. Nay theſe men, out of the holy Scriptures, ſo reſolutely are perſwaded, of the truth of God, conteyned therein, as without which, they know perfectly that the doctrine of the Goſpell can never powerfully floriſh, or be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with ſo high a Majeſtie in the hearts of men, as it ought to be. <note place="margin">The Goſpel hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the papiſt, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee can never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Goſpel.</note> And as for the other ſort, (the Papiſts I meane) alas that poore ratt, what overthrow can he worke to the Goſpell, whoſe bane the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell hath wrought ſo long ſince? Alas this faint ghoſt is ſo farre ſpent; his diſeaſe growne ſo deſperate, and his ſickneſſe, now at ſuch an hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now-hay, as all the phiſicke of all the Phiſitions in the world, can not recover his health, or once take away his head-ach. This ſilly ſnake, then having hiſſed out all his ſting, ſpit out all his venome, and ungor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelfe of all his poyſon, how can his skin, or how ſhould his taile anoy the Goſpell? If therefore it might pleaſe the Admoniſhers, upon a revew of our State, our countrey, and our people, to caſt ſuch men, as be open enemies to the Goſpell, into ſquadrons, cauſing them to march ranck by ranck, and troop by troop and delivering unto the King, a muſter roule, of all the names, qualities and conditions of the principall popiſh recuſants within the Realme (for none but ſuch only can be ſuſpected openly to band themſelves againſt the Goſpell) it is not to be doubted, but the leaſt part of all the other foure parts would be as great in number, as theſe. And what then ſhould the King and State feare the multitudes of Recuſants, when one ſtanding on the Kings ſide, ſhould be able to withſtand ten; and ten an hundred; and hundred a thouſand; and a thouſand ten thouſand papiſts.

If then by the abrogation of the Canon or Civill Law, ſcarce any one part of the lawes of this Realme ſhould be changed, what reaſon have we to thinke that the whole ſtate of the lawes of the Realme muſt be altered?

                  <p>But how may it be proved, that the Papall and forraign Canon law, is already taken away, and ought not to bee uſed in England?

And foraſmuch as ſuch Canons, Conſtitutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as heretofore have beene made by the Clergie or this Realme, can not, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> by reaſon of the ſhortneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be it therefore enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Kings Highneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall have power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the ſaid 32. perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall have power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to uiew, ſearch, and examine the ſaid canons, conſtitutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Provinciall and Synodal heretofore made, and ſuch of them as the Kings Highnes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall deeme and adjudg worthy to be continued and kept ſhall be from henceforth kept, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the reſidue of the ſaid Canons, conſtitutions, and ordinances provincial, which the K.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102527:17"/> never be put in execution within this Realme. Theſe are the words of the body of the Law: the words of the Proviſo are theſe: Provided <note place="margin">Canons provinciall already made only on authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the proviſo, therefore no papall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons in force.</note> that ſuch Canons, Conſtitutions, Ordinances, and Synodals Provinciall, being already made, which be not contrariant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall now ſtill be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and executed, as they were before the making of this Act, till ſuch time as they be viewed, ſearched, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which words of the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, body of the ſtatute, and proviſo, three things ſeeme principally to be meant and intended. Firſt an utter and abſolute abolition of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Conſtitutions, Ordinances, and Synodals, before that time made by the Clergie within the Realme, or by any forraigne power within the Realme whatſoever: Secondly a view, ſearch, and examination of all Canons, Conſtitutions and Ordinances Provinciall or Synodall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time made by the Clergy within the Realm: And laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church ſhould not utterly bee deſtitute of all Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Provinciall or Synodall) a reeſtabliſhment, or reauthoriſement of all ſuch of the ſaid Canons Provinciall or Synodall, as were not onerous to the people, contrariant or repugnant to the Lawes, Statutes, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Realme, nor prejudiciall to the Kings prerogative Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, was agreed upon, till the ſaid Provinciall Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſearched, and examined.</p>
                  <p>All Papall and forraigne Canon Law then, before that time made without the Realme, being once inhibited, to be attempted, alledged, claymed, or put in ure, and by conſequence adnihilated, aboliſhed and made voide: unleſſe the ſame be againe revived and reeſtabliſhed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine fruſtrate and adnulled ſtill, and therefore ought not to be attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, alleaged, claimed, or put in ure. Beſides, it is plaine, that forraign and Papall Canon Law was never intended to be reauthoriſed, becauſe the ſame Law was never committed to the view, ſearch and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King and 32. perſons. The King therefore and 32 perſons, by vertue of this act, not having any authoritie to view, ſearch and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine any forraign Canon Law, though he and they, had deemed and adjudged any part of the ſame Law, worthy to have beene continued, kept and obeyed, yet nevertheleſſe had not the ſame beene of any force or validitie. For only ſuch Canons, Conſtitutions, and Ordinances Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall or Synodall (being not contrariant, onerous or prejudiciall to the King, to the Lawes, or to the people) were reeſtabliſhed, as were committed. Beſides, whereas about twenty yeares paſſed, divers Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Conſtitutions and Ordinances, as well Papall as Provinciall, were alleaged by him that collected an Abſtract, againſt an unlearned miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, againſt Diſpenſations for many benefices, againſt excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and againſt Civill juriſdiction in Eccleſiaſticall perſons: the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102527:17"/> in the behalfe and maintenance of thoſe abuſes, challenged the author for not having proved his intent by law in force: affirming that <note place="margin">Tit. pag. 1. &amp; 2. The anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer unto the Abſtract. proveth by his reaſons the Papall Canon law now uſed to bee aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> the Canons and Lawes by him alleaged, were but pretended neceſſary and diſuſed lawes; that they were not inſpired with the life of lawes; that ſuch were fathered for lawes, as bee not Lawes; and that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained by him to be diſcuſſed how many of them were to be called in truth, her Majeſties lawes. The reaſon of all which his exceptions, he yeeldeth to be this: namely, that the Author ought to have proved them, not to have beene repugnant to the cuſtomes of the Realme, but to have beene in uſe and practice before the making of the act of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. For he muſt prove (ſaith the Anſwerer) that they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the cuſtomes of this Realme, and ſhew us how they have beene uſed and executed here, before the making of the ſtatute: yea he can ſay, that they are by law eſtabliſhed among us. Which points ſaith he, becauſe we learne by law, <hi>quod facta non praeſumantur,</hi> matters in fact, are not intended to be done, untill they be proved ſo: wee muſt ſtill put him to his proofes, and in the meane time ſay, that he hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped wide to ſay nothing to the purpoſe, and that in his whole booke, he hath talked but not reaſoned. All which aſſeveration of this Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, if the ſame be true, and, if this plea bee a good averment to bar the Author from having proved a learned miniſterie to be commanded by the law; diſpenſations for many benefices to be unlawfull, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication by one alone to be forbidden; and civill government to bee unlawfull in Eccleſiaſticall perſons, then much more forcibly may this argument be retorted, upon all ſuch as claime, alleage and put in ure any portion of the forraigne Canon Law. For ſithence it hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet beene proved, that the forraign Canon Law, uſed and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at this day, was accuſtomed and uſed 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. then becauſe wee learne by law (as he ſaith) <hi>quod facta non prae ſumantur,</hi> wee muſt ſtill put him, and his clients to their proofe, and in the meane while tell them, that their Advocate hath twiſted for them but a bad thread, when by his reaſon he hath untwined all their lawes, and broken a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bands of their government. Moreover becauſe it is not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the forraigne and Papall Canon Law is not contrariant nor repugnant to the Lawes, ſtatutes or cuſtomes of the Realme, nor dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie to the prerogatives of the regall Crown; nay becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorie hereof is affirmed, and this denyed: and becauſe we learn by law (as he ſaith) that matters in fact, are not intended to be done till they be proved ſo, we muſt ſtill put the upholders and executioners of this law, to their proofe, and in the meane while tell them that the forraigne and Papall Law, is but a pretended neceſſary and diſuſed law,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102527:18"/> that it is not inſpired with the life of Law, and that it is fathered by them to be ſuch a Law, as is an headleſſe, a fetherleſſe and a nockleſſe arrow which is not fit to be drawne, or ſhot againſt any ſubject of the King. And from this voidance, abolition and nullitie of forraigne and papall Canon Law (becauſe <hi>ſublato principali, tolluntur acceſſoria)</hi> it followeth that all offices and functions of papall Archbiſhops, papall Biſhops, papall Suffraganes, papall Archdeacons, papall Deanes and Chapters, papall Prieſts, papall Deacons, papall Subdeacons, papall Chancellors, papall Vicars generall, papall Commiſſaries, and papall Officials, meerely depending upon the authoritie, and drawne from the rules and grounds of that Law, are likewiſe adnihilated, and of no value. Howbeit for ſo much as by the opinion of ſome learned Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians, <note place="margin">By the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Civilians, the papall Canon law ſeemeth to be in force.</note> there ſeemeth unto them, a neceſſary continuance of the ſame forraigne and papall Law, by reaſon that Archbiſhops, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops doe now lawfully (as they ſay) uſe ordinarie Archiepiſcopall and Epiſcopall juriſdiction, which they could not (as they thinke) doe, if the ſame common law were utterly aboliſhed: and for ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as ſome learned in the Canon lawes, do maintaine, that ſince the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <note place="margin">Apology of certain pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceedings in Courts Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical.</note> of 1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. the Archbiſhop and Biſhop cannot lawfully claim any ordinarie ſpirituall juriſdiction at all, but that the ſpirituall juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to be exerciſed by them, ought to bee delegated unto them from the King, by a Commiſſion under the great Seale: Foraſmuch (I ſay) as there are theſe differences of opinions, it ſeemeth expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be conſidered, by what law, and by what authoritie, Archbiſhops and Biſhops exerciſe Archiepiſcopall and Epiſcopall power in the Church: And to the end this queſtion may fully bee knowne, and no ſcruple nor ambiguitie be left, what power ſpirituall may be intended <note place="margin">Power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and improperly called ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. Queens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct. and execut. of juſtice.</note> to be exerciſed by them: We diſtinguiſh ſpirituall power, into a power properly called ſpirituall; and into a power improperly or abuſively called ſpirituall, Ther power properly called ſpirituall, is that ſpirituall power, which conſiſteth, and is converſant in preaching the Word; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the Sacraments; ordaining and depoſing Miniſters, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating or abſolving; and if there bee any other ſpirituall power of the like property and nature. Now that this power properly called <note place="margin">Power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called ſpirituall, was never in the Queenes perſon.</note> ſpirituall, could have beene drawne from the perſon of our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lady the Queene unto Archbiſhops and Biſhops, we deny. For the Queenes Royall perſon, being never capable of any part of this ſpirituall power, how could the ſame bee derived from her perſon unto them? <hi>Nemo poteſt plus juris in alium transferre, quam ipſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</hi> Archiepiſcopall and Epiſcopall power therefore, exerciſed in, and about theſe myſteries of our holy Religion, ordinarily and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102527:18"/> muſt belong unto the Archbiſhop and Biſhop by the canon of the holy Scriptures; otherwiſe they have no power (properly called <note place="margin">Power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly called ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but a temporall power.</note> ſpirituall) touching theſe things at all. The power which improperly is called ſpirituall, is ſuch a power, as reſpecteth not the exerciſe of any paſtorall or miniſteriall Church, to the internall begetting of faith, or reforming of manners in the ſoule of man; but is ſuch a power, as wherby publike peace, equitie, and juſtice is preſerved, and maintained in externall things, peculiarly appropried, and appertaining unto the perſons, or affaires of the Church; which power indeed is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a temporall or civill power, and is to bee exerciſed onely by the authoritie of Temporall and Civill Magiſtrates. Now then to returne to the ſtate of the point in Queſtion touching this later power, improperly called ſpirituall, by what law, or by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie the Archbiſhops and Biſhops doe exerciſe this kinde of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the Church: I anſwer that they cannot have the ſame, from any forraigne Canon Law, becauſe the ſame Law, with all the powers and dependences thereof is adnulled: And therefore that this their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, muſt and ought to be derived unto them from Bb. where, From whence then is their power derived? Hereunto we anſwer, that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the making of that act) ſpirituall juriſdiction did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unto Biſhops, and that Biſhops were ordinaries, aſwell by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Realme, canons, conſtitutions, and ordinances provincial and ſynodall, as by forraigne canon law. And that therefore theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, conſtitutions and ordinances provinciall or ſynodall, according to <note place="margin">Biſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries by cuſtome, provinciall Canons, &amp; ſtatute law, though pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Canon law be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. 25. h. 8. c, 20. 25. h 8. c <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>6.</note> the true intent of that act, could not ſtill have been uſed and executed as they were before, if the Biſhops had not ſtill remained ordinaries. Moreover it is cleare by two ſtatutes, that the Archbiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ought to be obeyed in all manner of things, according to the name, title, degree, and dignitie, that they ſhall be choſen, or preſented unto, and that they may doe and execute, miniſter, uſe, and exerciſe all and every thing and things, touching or pertaining to the office or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of an Archbiſhop or Biſhop, with all enſignes, tokens and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thereunto lawfully belonging, as any Archbiſhop or Biſhop might at any time heretofore do, without offending of the prerogative royall of the Crown, and the laws and cuſtomes of this Realm. Let it be then that by cuſtome, canons provinciall and ſtatute law, Biſhops be and do remaine ordinaries; yet aſwell upon thoſe words of the ſtatute 25. <hi>H</hi> 8. without offending of the prerogative Royall, as upon the ſtatute of 1. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1 there remaineth a ſcruple and ambiguitie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not hurtfull, or derogatorie unto the Kings Prerogative Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; that Ordinaries ſhould uſe and exerciſe their ordinarie power
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102527:19"/> (improperly called ſpirituall) without a commiſſion under the great Seale, or that ſuch their power ſhould be as immoderate, and exceſſive now, as in times paſt it was by the Papall Canon law? Concerning the firſt, by the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. and by the Statute of 8 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. the Queene was recognized to be in effect the Ordinarie of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, <note place="margin">The Queen was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</note> that is the chief ſupreme and ſoveraign Ordinary over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in all cauſes, aſwell Eccleſiaſticall as Temporall. Where it ſeemeth to follow, that all the branches, and ſtreams, aſwell of that power which improperly is called ſpiritual, as of that power which properly is called temporall, ſhould have beene derived originally unto the Biſhop from her Highneſſe perſon, as from the only head and fountain of all the ſame ſpirituall power within her Kingdomes, in ſuch manner and form, and by ſuch commiſſion under the great Seal, as her <hi>H.</hi> temporall Officers, Juſticers and Judges, had their authorities committed unto them. And to this opinion Maſter D. <hi>Bilſon</hi> ſeemeth to accord. For all power <note place="margin">Pag. 348.</note> (ſaith he) is not only committed to the ſword, which God hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed, but is wholly cloſed in the ſword. Againſt the head, that it ſhall not be head, to rule and guide the feet, can be no preſcription; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Gods Ordinance, for the head to governe the body, is a perpetuall and eternall law: and the uſurpation of the members againſt it, is no preſcription but a confuſion, and the ſubverſion of that order, which the <note place="margin">Pag. 114. &amp; 130.</note> God of heaven hath immutably decreed and ſetled. Beſides there reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (ſaith the Remonſtrance) unto the Biſhops of this Realme, none other but ſubordinate, and delegate authoritie: and that the matter and heads wherein this juriſdiction is occupied, are by, and from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates authoritie: In whom, as ſupreme Governour, all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, within her Dominions, aſwell Eccleſiaſticall as Civill, by Gods and mans law is inveſted, and their authoritie Eccleſiaſticall is but ſubordinate under God and the Prince, derived for the moſt part from the Prince. From which two Statutes and judgements of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rernours of the Church contained in theſe two bookes (for theſe two <note place="margin">1 Eliz. c. 1 &amp; 8 Eliz. c. 1.</note> books were ſeen and allowed by the Governours of the Church) I leave it to be conſidered, if the Biſhop did exerciſe the ſame improper and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive ſpirituall power and juriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall only and alonely, in their owne names, ſtiles and dignities, and under their own ſeales of office, and that alſo by authoritie of forraign and Papall laws; if (I ſay) the Biſhop did theſe things, after this and this manner, I leave it then to be conſidered, whether their exerciſe of ſuch power were derogatory and prejudiciall in a very high degree, to the prerogatives of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Crown or not. For my part becauſe I finde by the forraign Canon Law, that Papall Biſhops bee the Popes ſonnes, and are priviledged
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102527:19"/> to carry the print and image of the Pope their father, namely, that they have <hi>plenitudinem poteſtatis</hi> within their Dioceſſes, as the Pope preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">Ex. de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor. &amp; obe.</note> to have power over the whole world: For <hi>quilibet ordinarius</hi> ſaith the ſame law in <hi>ſua Dioeceſi est major quolibet principe,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo (notwithſtanding whatſoever the B b. have written, that <note place="margin">M.

                     </gap>hey did intrude themſelves into the Royall preeminences, priviledges, and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Queene. For by what other authoritie, than by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">The Bb. by a plenary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> power de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viſed and promulged new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Queenes aſſent.</note> plenarie power, did they in their owne names, for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſeverall Churches within their ſeverall Dioceſſes, from time to time, make, promulge, and by vertue of mens corporall oathes put in execution, what new Canons, Injunctions, and Articles ſoever ſeemed good unto them, without any licence or confirmation from the Queene, firſt had and obtained thereunto? By which pretenſed plenarie power, it ſeemeth that the ſtatute made to bring the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie in ſubmiſſion to the King, was covertly deluded, and our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lady the Queene, cunningly bereaved of that regall authoritie, over every particular Dioceſan, or Ordinarie, which notwithſtanding, by the Parliament was given unto her Highneſſe, over the whole body and ſtate of the Clergie. For if once there bee no neceſſitie of the Kings licence, aſſent, or confirmation to ſuch Articles, Canons, or Injunctions, as every Ordinarie ſhall make within his juriſdiction, then muſt it be intended, that the Statute of ſubmiſſion hath covertly permitted, ſeverall members, ſeverally to doe, and to execute thoſe things which apparently, and in expreſſe terms, the whole convocation was commanded, and with the ſame, in <hi>verbo ſacerdotii,</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not to doe: then the which what can ſeeme more unreaſonable and abſurd? For then might all the Ordinaries joyne hand in hand, and agree all together in one, never in any of their convocations, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, by the Kings Writ, to deviſe, make, or promulge any Canons Eccleſiaſticall at all. And what aſſent, licence, or confirmation from the King, could then be needfull? Or how then was the Clergie, brought in ſubmiſſion to the King? For then, ſhould it not be with them, as it is in the proverbe; A threefold cord is not eaſily broken: but then ſhould it be with them, contrary to the proverbe; for they being all faſt knit and bound together unto the Kings authoritie, by a cord of twenty foure threads, might eaſily be broken; but being ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

                  <p>The conſequence of his major propoſition being falſe, he laboureth notwithſtanding to make the ſame good, and in effect for the ſame argueth thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All temporall authoritie, as abſolutely and as really, is reveſted in the perſon of the Queene, as is the ſaid ſpirituall authoritie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore as all ſpirituall Officers, for the execution of the ſaid ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power; muſt have their authoritie, derived unto them from the perſon of the Queene under the great Seale, ſo likewiſe muſt all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall officers, for the execution of their temporall offices, have the like commiſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſequence of which enthimeme followeth not, though the antecedent be true. For although as well all temporall, as all the ſaid ſpirituall authoritie improperly ſo called, was really and abſolutely in the perſon of the Queene; yet hereupon it followeth not, that by one and the ſelfe ſame meanes alone, and namely, by a commiſſion under the great Seale, all temporall and the ſaid ſpirituall power, in every part and branch thereof, ſhould be drawne alike, from the Queenes perſon. For there be divers and ſundry meanes, to derive temporall authority, wheras there ſeemeth to be but one only means to derive the ſaid ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102527:20"/> authoritie, and then marke the ſubſtance of the authors argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some temporall Officers, as Stewards of Leets, Conſtables, and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other Officers, must not draw their temporall authoritie from the Queene by a Commiſſion under the great Seale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Which argument drawne from a particular affirmative, unto a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall negative, what weakneſſe it hath, every young Logician can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. And as for Stewards of Leets, though they have no Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Though all temporall officers draw not their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the King by the great ſeale yet by one meanes or other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it from the King.</note> under the great Seale, yet for the execution of their Stewardſhips they have a Commiſſion under the Seale of the Exchequer, Conſtables, Decennary or Tythingmen, and Thirdboroughs, have their authorities derived unto them from the Kings perſon, by the very originall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their offices, Sheriffs of Countries, Coroners, Eſcheators, and Uerderors, have their offices and their authorities warranted unto them, by the Kings writs out of the Chancerie. But it was not the minde of the Law-makers (ſaith the Author) that the Ordinaries, by a commiſſion under the great Seale, ſhould draw their ſaid ſpirituall power from the Queen. What the mindes of the Law-makers were, touching this point, it mattereth little or nothing at all. Neither is it to purpoſe, whether a commiſſion under the great ſeale, be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required, or not required by vertue of that ſtatute, 1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. to warrant the ſaid ſpirituall power unto Ordinaries. Only it ſufficeth, that the Queen having all power, improperly called ſpiritual, inveſted in her Royall perſon, and being really and actually ſeiſed of all the ſaid ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ſpirituall authoritie, could not have any part of the ſame ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power drawne from her, but by ſome one lawfull and ordinarie meanes or other. For if this rule be true in every common perſon, <hi>quod meum eſt, ſine mea voluntate à me auferri non poteſt;</hi> how much more doth the ſame rule hold, in the Royall prerogatives, rights, priviledges, dignities, and ſupremities of a King? wherfore to ſay that all ſupreme and ordinarie power (improperly called) ſpirituall, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and actually inherent in the Royall perſon of the Queen, and to ſay alſo, that ſome of the ſame inferiour, and ordinarie power, not derived from the Queen, was nevertheleſſe in the perſons of inferiour ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is as much to ſay, that ſome branches of a tree, may receive nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from elſewhere than from the root; that ſome members of the bodie, are not guided by the head; and that ſome ſtreames, flow not from their fountaines. And now to conclude this part, againſt the Canon Law, and their Offices and functions thereof, I diſpute thus:</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102527:21"/>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore the ſame law is no part of the lawes of the Realm; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo it is evident, that there will not follow any alteration of the Lawes of the Realme, by the taking of it away.</hi>

                  <p>Which Canon Law alſo, with other lawes and functions, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily the ſame without any inconveniences, may bee ſupplied, ſhall (God willing) be preſently made apparant, if firſt we ſhall anſwer to that challenge, which the ſtate of Prelacie may ſeeme to make for the continuance of their Lordly primacie, out of the words of the great <note place="margin">Challenge for Lordly primacy, out of the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Charter.

                     <hi>Charta noſtra confirmavimus, pro nobis &amp; haeredibus noſtris, in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, quod Eccleſia Anglicana libera ſit, &amp; habeat omnia jura ſua integra, &amp; libertates ſuas illaeſas.</hi> We have granted unto God, and by this our preſent writing have confirmed for us, and for our heires for ever, that the Church of England be free, and that ſhe have all her rights, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties whole and unhurt. Now by this Charter, if the ſame bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued aright, there is proviſion made; firſt, that ſuch honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be yeelded by the King and his ſubjects, his and their ſucceſſors and poſteritie unto God, as truly, and indeed belongeth unto him: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that not only ſuch rights and liberties, as the King and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, but alſo that ſuch as God had endowed the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with ſhould inviolably be preſerved. And in very deed, to ſpeake truly and properly ſuch rights and liberties only, are to be called, the rights and liberties of the Church of England, which God himſelfe hath given by his Law unto his univerſall Church, and not which the Kings of England, by their Charter, have bequeathed to the particular Church of England. When therefore queſtion is made that by the great Charter, the Kings of England are bound to maintaine the rights and liberties of the Church of England, wee are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and ſearch what rights and liberties, God in his holy word, hath granted unto his univerſall Church; and ſo by conſequence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of England, one part of the Catholike Church. And this queſtionleſſe was the cauſe, that moved the victorious Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, ſo effectually and powerfully to bend himſelfe againſt the Popes ſupremacie, uſurped that time over the Church of England.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102527:21"/> For (ſaith the King) we will with hazard of our life, and loſſe of our Crowne, uphold and defend in our Realmes whatſoever wee ſhall know to be the will of God. The Church of God then in England, not being free, nay having her rights and liberties according to the great Charter, whole and unhurt, but being in bondage and ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the Sea of Rome, contrary to the Law of God; the King judged it to ſtand highly with his honour, and with his oath (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of knowledge, which then was given unto him) to reforme, redreſſe, and amend the abuſes of the ſame Sea. If then it might pleaſe our gracious Soveraigne Lord King <hi>Iames,</hi> that now is (treading in the Godly ſteps of his renowned great Vncle) to vouchſafe an aboliſhment of all lordly primacie, executed by Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall, and Epiſcopall authoritie, over the Miniſters of Chriſt; His Highneſſe in ſo doing, could no more rightly bee charged with the violation of the great Charter, than might King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight with the baniſhment of the Popes ſupremacie; or than our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Ladie the Queene could be juſtly burthened with the breach of her oath, by the eſtabliſhment of the Goſpell. Nay if the Kings of England, by reaſon of their oath, had beene ſo ſtraightly tyed to the words of the great Charter, that they might not in any ſort, have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled any ſuppoſed rights, and liberties of the Church then uſed and confirmed by the great Charter, unto the Church that then was ſuppoſed, to be the Church of God in England; then belike King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, might be attainted to have gone againſt the great Charter, and againſt his oath, when by the overthrow of Abbies and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he tooke away the rights and liberties of the Abbots and Priors. For by expreſſe words of the great Charter, Abbots and Priors, had as ample and as large a Patent, for their rights and liberties, as our Archbb. and Biſhops can at this day challenge for their primacies. If then the rights and liberties of the one, as being againſt the law of God, be duly and lawfully taken away, notwithſtanding any matter, clauſe or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, contained in the great Charter; the other have but little reaſon by colour of the great Charter, to ſtand upon their pantofles, and to contend for their painted ſheathes. For this is a rule and maxime in all good lawes, that in <hi>omni juramento, ſemper excipitur authoritas majoris:</hi> unleſſe then they bee able to juſtifie by the holy Scriptures that ſuch rights and liberties, as they pretend for their ſpirituall primacie over the Miniſters of Chriſt, to be granted unto them by the great Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But we deny the aſſumption, and affirme that Civilians might have <note place="margin">The main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Civilians, dependeth not upon the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Canon law.</note> farre better reward and maintenance than now they have, if the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and functions of the Canon Law, and ſuch things as are contained within the ſame, were ſimply and abſolutely taken away. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſay, if there were none other uſe, nor end of the ſtudie of the Civill Law, than hope of reward, and maintenance by ſome office and function of the Canon Law, that then Civilians ſhould in vaine ſeeke for knowledge in the Civill Law, becauſe without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, and by the onely knowledge of ſuch things, as are within the Compaſſe of the Canon Law, they might reape that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and maintainance. Nay ſithence by experience we have known that ſome, who never unclaſped the inſtitutions of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> out of the ſame to learne the definition of Civill Juſtice, have beene and yet are authorized, to exerciſe the offices and functions of the Canon Law;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102527:22"/> how ſhould the ſtudie of the civill law, be furthered by theſe offices and functions, when as without any knowledge of the civill law, theſe offices and functions have beene and yet are daily undertaken, and executed to the full? And what man then (if there were none other reward for Civilians) would ten or twelve yeares together, beat his braine, and trouble his wits, in the ſtudie of the Civill Law, when every ſilly Canoniſt might bee able and learned enough, to ſit in the Biſhops throne, and to be judge in his Conſiſtorie? Beſides, if the Admonitor ſpeake ſooth, <hi>viz.</hi> that Civilians in this Realm, live not by the uſe of the civill Law, to what end then ſhould he feare an overthrow of the ſtudie thereof? For if there be no uſe of it in this Realme, for the maintenance of this life, to what uſe then ſhould men ſtudie the ſame in this Realme? As for the uſe of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſtrangers, and forraigne nations without the Realme; the ſame (as I ſuppoſe) is no greater than ſuch as 3. or 4. Civilians may be able well enough, fully to deliver the law, touching all matters of controverſie, that may grow to queſtion during the whole ſpace of a Kings raigne. If no man lived in this Realme, by the trade of brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beere, but that all Brewers did live by the trade of Brewing Ale, what ſhould we need to feare the decay of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eere-brewers, or what uſe were there of them? in like ſort, if men live only by the uſe, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and functions of the Canon Law, and that men live not (as he ſaith) by the uſe of the Civill law within the Realme, what folly were it to ſtudie the one, whereas without the knowledge thereof, he might live by the other? And therefore it ſeemeth that the Admonitor by his owne weapon, as much as in him lay, hath given the whole ſtudie of the Civill Law, a moſt deſperate and deadly wound. And to the end we may underſtand what reward and maintenance, Civilians by the Offices and functions of the Canon, do receive yearly for their ſervice and attendance, in the Biſhops and Archdeacons their Courts; Wee will examine what fees Doctors of the civill law, being Chancellors, Commiſſaries or Officials, have uſually, and ordinarily allowed unto them, by their Lords and Maſters. Fees for probat of Teſtaments, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Fees for probat of teſtaments let to farm.</note> of adminiſtrations, with their appendances, of late years in ſome places (whether in all or how many I know not) have beene demiſed unto farm for an annuall rent; out of which, either a ſmall or no portion at all, have beene allowed unto the Chancellor or Officiall, for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in this behalf. Whereupon (as I conjecture) it hath fallen out, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that thoſe Officers would worke, keepe Courts, and travaile for little or nought, ther have been exacted greater fees, for the diſpatch of theſe things, than by law ought to have bin paid. Perquiſits of courts
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102527:23"/> ariſing upon ſuites, commenced betweene partie and partie, it muſt be a plentifull harveſt, and there muſt be <hi>multi amici curiae,</hi> in a Biſhops conſiſtorie, if ordinarily <hi>(communibus annis)</hi> they amount in the whole to twenty pounds by the yeare: and yet theſe perquiſits, belong not wholly to the Chancellor, but are to be devided between him and the Regiſter. And touching fees for excommunication, and abſolution, fees for inſtitution and induction, licences to preach, licences for Curats and Readers. For teſtimoniall of ſubſcription, or licences to marry without banes; fees for commutation of penance, and fees for relaxation of ſequeſtrations: touching theſe manner of Fees, if the ſame be fees no <note place="margin">Fees due for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the canon law, diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Doctor of the civill Law.</note> way warrantable, how are not then ſuch fees every way diſhonourable for a Doctor of the Civill law, to take, either of Miniſters or people? There muſt be therefore ſome other hope of better reward and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, to incite and incourage ſchollars, to the ſtudie of the civill law, than are theſe beggerly and unlawfull fees, depending upon the functions, and exacted by the Officers of the Canon law: or els the uſe of the civill law (as the Admonitor ſaith) muſt neceſſarily in ſhort time be overthrown. For if Fees for probat of Teſtaments, and granting of adminiſtrations with their appendices, ſhall ſtill be let to farme; and if alſo, many unlawfull fees were quite inhibited, there would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine (I trow) but a very poore pittance for Civilians out of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Canon law, to maintain their Doctoralities withall. But what better reward can there bee for Civilians, than hath already beene mentioned? If the Admonitor had not willingly put a hood <note place="margin">Civilians in England live not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the functions of Canon law.</note> wincke before his eyes, he might have ſeene that the Civilians live not wholly and altogether by the practice of the Canon Law; but partly alſo, and that moſt honourably by the uſe of the Civill law. If a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Civill Law, be judge or Advocate, in the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie; if he be Judge or Advocate in the Prerogative Court, ſo farre as the ſame Court handleth only matters of Legacies, Teſtaments and Codicills, to what uſe can the Canon Law ſerve him, or what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage can the ſame Law bring him in? Beſide to what uſe ſerveth the Canon Law unto a Doctor of the Civill Law, if he ſhall finde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the Kings ſight, and if it pleaſe the King to make him one of the Maſters of his Requeſts, or one of the twelve Maſters of his high Court of Chancery, or to be the Maſter of his Rolls; or to be his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Embaſſador unto forraigne Nations, or to be one of his Highnes moſt honourable privie Councel, or to be one of his principall Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries. It followeth not therefore (as the Admonitor pretendeth) that either the Civilians in this Realme, live not by the uſe of the civill law but by the offices, and functions of the Canon law, and ſuch things as,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102527:23"/> are within the compaſſe thereof; or that the hope of reward, and by that means, the whole ſtudie of the Civill Law muſt be taken away, if once the Canon Law ſhould be aboliſhed. Neither would it bee any hard matter for the King (if the Civilians might find grace in his ſight) to appoint Courts, Offices, and all manner of proceſſe and proceedings in judgement for Doctors of the Civill Law, to heare and determine in the Kings name, all cauſes being now within the compaſſe of any Civill or Eccleſiaſticall Law within this Realme. And although a little candle can give but a little light, and a ſmall Spring can ſend forth but a ſmall ſtreame, yet becauſe great fires are kindled ſometimes by little ſparkles, and ſmall ſtreames meeting together, may in time grow into great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And to theend, the true intent and meaning of the ſaid ſtatute, made in the firſt year of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the ſixth, may be declared and revived, that likewiſe by the authoritie aforeſaid, it may be ordained, and enacted, that all and ſingular Eccleſiaſticall Courts, and Conſiſtories, belonging to any Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Suffraganes, College, Deane and Chapter, Prebendarie, or to any Eccleſiaſticall perſon or perſons whatſoever, and which have heretofore beene commonly called, reputed, taken or knowne to be Courts or Conſiſtories, for cauſes of inſtance, or wherein any ſuite, complaint or action, betweene partie and partie, for any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or cauſe wherein judgement of law civill or Canon, hath beene or is required, ſhall and may for ever hereafter be reputed, taken, and adjudged to be Courts, and judgement ſeates meerely Civill, ſecular and temporall, and not henceforth Eccleſiaſticall or Spirituall; and as of right belonging and appertaining to the Royall Crowne and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of our Soveraigne Lord King <hi>James</hi> that now is, his heires and ſucceſſors for ever.

               <p>And at the humble ſuite of the Commons, may it pleaſe the King to have it further enacted, That all manner of fees heretofore lawfull, or hereafter by the King and Parliament to be made lawfull, for or, concerning the probat of Wills; adminiſtration of the goods of the inteſtat; letters of tuition; receiving or making of accompts, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to Archbiſhoprickes, Biſhoprickes, Deanries, Parochiall-Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or other ſpirituall promotions, and all other fees whatſoever heretofore lawfull, or hereafter to be made lawfull, for any travaile or paine to bee taken in or about the expedition or execution of any of theſe cauſes, ſhall for ever hereafter be fees, and allowances appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the Judges, and principall Regiſters of the ſaid Courts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to bee devided betweene them, as heretofore hath beene accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed; and that the ſaid Judges and Miniſters, within their ſeverall charges, ſhall be Collectors of the Kings tenths and ſubſidies, granted and due by the Clergie, taking for their travaile and paine, in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame collection, ſuch fees as heretofore have beene accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Provided alwayes, that none of the ſaid civill and temporall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Miniſters, nor any of them, for any offence, contempt or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, to be committed by any perſon, or perſons, in any wiſe incident to any of the ſaid Courts and Conſiſtories, ſuſpend, excommunicate, or interdict any perſon or perſons, but ſhall and lawfully may by authority
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102527:26"/> of this preſent Act, proceed againſt every offender, and offenders by ſuch ordinarie proceſſe, out of the ſaid Regiſter or Notaries office, as is uſed upon a <hi>ſub-paena</hi> out of the high Court of Chancerie, and there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on default, or contempt, to proceed to attachment, proclamation of rebellion, and impriſonment of the partie offending, as in the ſaid high Court of Chancery is uſed. Provided alſo, that all appeales, hereafter to bee made, from all and every Court, and Courts in the Shires and Dioceſſes of the Countrey, ſhall bee made to the higher Courts, as heretofore hath beene accuſtomed, only with an alteration, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the names, ſtiles and dignities of Archbiſhops, Biſhops and other Ordinaries, unto the name, ſtile and dignitie of our Soveraigne Lord the King, his heires and ſucceſſors. And that upon the appeales, ſo to be made, it ſhall and may be lawfull, for the Judges and Miniſters of Juſtice, of and in the ſaid higher Courts, to make out all manner of proceſſe, and proceſſes, and to do and execute all and every act and acts, thing and things, for the furtherance of Juſtice, in the cauſes aforeſaid, as to them ſhalby the law ſeem equal, right, meet, and convenient; any law ſtatute, priviledg, diſpenſation, preſcription, uſe or cuſtom, heretofore to the contrarie in any wiſe notwithſtanding. Provided alſo that all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie ſuch Judge and Miniſter, that ſhall execute any thing by vertue of this act, ſhall from time to time obey the Kings writ, and writs of prohibition, of attachment upon prohibition and indicavit, and not to proceed contrary to the tenour of ſuch writ or writs, in ſuch and the ſame manner and form, and condition, as they have or ought to have done be ore the making of this act, any thing in this act to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary notwithſtanding.

               <p>And thus it may ſeeme to be but a ſmall labour, a little coſt, and an eaſie matter, for the King, his Nobles and Wiſemen of the Realme, to deviſe formes of judgement, and manner of proceſſe, and proceedings, without any offices or functions of the Canon law, whereby the uſe and ſtudie of the Civill Law, and the reward and maintenance for Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians, might be furthered and increaſed, and not utterly overthrown and taken away; as the Admonitor uncivily beareth us in hand.

                  <p>Indeed we hold, that all theſe matters wherof mention is here made, <note place="margin">Matters of tythes and other cauſes of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pertain to civill ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> and all others of the like nature, are merely civill and temporall, and by the temporall Magiſtrate alone, to be dealt in, and to bee diſcuſſed, if we conſider the adminiſtration of externall and civil juſtice. And this we thinke will be granted of all, and not to be denyed of any unleſſe they be too too popiſhly addicted. In regard whereof we have drawn (as before is mentioned) a project, how Courts and manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and proceedings in judgement, by Doctors of the Civill Law may be appointed by the King, and his high Court of Parliament, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, that the common Law of the Realme, by the occaſion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch courts, offices, or manner of proceſſe and proceedings, muſt receive any alteration at all, much leſſe a very great alteration.

                  <p>By a Statute of 32. H. 8. c, 7. it is cleare, that all tyths, oblations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other Eccleſiaſticall or Spirituall profits, by the lawes and ſtatutes of the Realme, may be made temporall, as being admitted to be, abide and goe to, and in temporall hands, lay-uſes and profits. From the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which ſtatute it is cleare, that thoſe lawes likewiſe, may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned amongſt us for temporall lawes, which by the lawes and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Realme, may be executed by temporall and lay perſons, and which are converſant about temporal and lay cauſes. If then the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lawes, touching theſe matters may lawfully remaine, and abide in the hands of Doctors of the Civill Law, being temporall and lay perſons (as alreadie under the Biſhops they doe;) it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but that the Kings Judges, and Juſtices, of both benches, may bee as competible Judges, to put in execution the lawes concerning theſe matters, as Doctors of the Civill Law, or other lay men be. But the cauſes are not reputed and called temporall, and lay cauſes amongſt us. What for that? if in their owne nature ſimply conſidered, theſe cauſes be merely lay and temporall cauſes, ſuch cauſes (I meane) as whereof the King a lay, civill and temporall Magiſtrate, by his lay civill and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Magiſtracie derived unto him immediately from the holy law of God, may and ought to take cognizance, and thereupon, either in his owne Royall perſon, or by the perſon of any of his inferiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, may give abſolute and peremptorie judgement: If (I ſay) theſe things be ſo, what booteth it, or what wiſedome is it to contend, that theſe cauſes and matters, have been, and are ſtill adjudged to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Eccleſiaſticall, and no temporall cauſes, becauſe through an abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpeech, or through a vaine and evill cuſtome, they have beene ſo led and accompted in times paſt? And what if it hath pleaſed the Kings Progenitors, by ſufferance to tolerate the executions of ſuch Lawes, as concerne theſe things, to bee in the hands and power of Eccleſiaſticall perſons; yet hereupon it followeth not that in very deede and truth, the Magiſtracie of the ſaid Eccleſiaſticall perſons, was an Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtracie, or that they were Eccleſiaſticall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; but their Magiſtracie was, and remained ſtill a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall magiſtracie, and they were and abode temporall Magiſtrates. For not more can the qualitie of the perſon, alter the nature of the cauſe, than can the qualitie of the cauſe, alter the nature of the perſon. And if it be true, that matters determinable (in times paſt) by a Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102527:27"/> abuſively called Eccleſiaſticall, be notwithſtanding properly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters, and that the ſame Magiſtracie alſo, be a temporall and no ſpirituall Magiſtracie, what a childiſh and poore conceit is it, to challenge and threp upon the temporall Magiſtrate, that he hath none, or very few temporall lawes, touching thoſe matters, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people ſhould not ſolicit an alteration of abuſes in Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, left for want of temporall lawes, the people ſhould bee without Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline? It will be no ſmall matter (ſaith he) to apply theſe things to the temporall law; yea, and ſo ſay I to. But what of that? The queſtion is not how hardly theſe things may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the temporall law, but how ſmall a matter it were to apply the temporall law unto theſe things. For it is not ſaid in any law, that, <hi>caſus ex juribus,</hi> but it is ſaid in all lawes, that <hi>ex caſibus jura naſcuntur.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall law may eaſily be applyed to cauſes now reputed Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note> And indeed the Phiſition applyeth not the diſeaſe to his Phiſick, but he prepareth his phificke for the diſeaſe.

                  <p>Theſe and ſuch like are the chiefe matters of fact, whereupon in the <note place="margin">The Kings Iuſtices are as able to judge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt tyths as the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Iudges.</note> Eccleſiaſticall Courts, proofes by witneſſes, or records reſt to be made for the recoverie of tythes.

If there be any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alleaged by the defendant, as of compoſition, preſcription, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, the Kings Juſtices are as able to judge of the validitie, of theſe, as they are now able eo determine cuſtomes <hi>de modo decimandi,</hi> or of the uſe of high wayes, of making and repairing of Bridges, of Commons of paſture, pawnage, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſtovers, or ſuch like. Truth it is that of Legacies and bequeſts of goods, the reverend Biſhops by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance <note place="margin">Legacies how they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law.</note> of our Kings and conſent of our people, have accuſtomably u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to take cognizance, and to hold plea, in their ſpirituall Courts. Notwithſtanding if the Legacie bee of lands, where lands be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by Teſtament, the judgement thereof hath beene alwayes uſed, and holden by the Kings writ, and never in any Eccleſiaſticall Court. Wherefore if it ſhall pleaſe the King, to enlarge the authoritie of his Courts temporall, by commanding matters of legacies and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of goods, aſwell as of lands, to be heard, and determined in the ſame, it were not much to be feared, but that the kings Juſtices, the kings learned Counſell, and others learned in the Law of the Realm, without any alteration of the ſame law, would ſpeedily finde meanes, to apply the grounds thereof, aswell to all caſes of Legacies, and bequeſts of goods, as of lands. For if there be no goods diviſible by will, but the ſame are grantable, and confirmable, by deed of gift, could not the kings Juſtices, aſwell judge of the gift, and of the thing given by will, as of the grant, and of the thing granted by deed of gift? or can they not determine of a Legacie of goods, aſwell as of a bequeſt of lands? If it ſhould come in debate before them, whether the Teſtator, at that time of making his will, were of good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect memorie, upon proofs and other circumſtances to be opened, and made of the Teſtators memorie by lively teſtimonies, either the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitor muſt condemne the kings learned and diſcreet Juſtices to bee <hi>malae mentis &amp; inſanae memoriae,</hi> or els it muſt be confeſſed, that they be as well able to judge of the diſtraction of wits and unſoundneſſe of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102527:29"/> memorie, in a perſon deceaſed, as they be to determine the queſtion of Lunacie, madneſſe, or idiocie, in a man living.</p>
                  <p>If any queſtion ſhould ariſe upon the revocation of a former will, of the ademption of a legacie, or of a legacie given upon condition, or in <hi>diem,</hi> it would be no hard matter, for the learned Judges, upon ſight of the will, and proofes to be made, to define which is the firſt, and which is the laſt wil; whether the legacie remaine, or whether it be revoked, whether it be <hi>legatum per rerum</hi> or <hi>in diem,</hi> whether conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal or without condition: And if it bee conditionall, whether the ſame be poſſible or impoſſible; honeſt, or diſhoneſt; and if it bee in <hi>diem,</hi> whether the day be paſt, or to come. But there lyeth no action at the common law, for a legatorie againſt the executor to recover his legacie. I grant. But a creditor to recover his debt, due by the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor upon ſpecialtie, may bring an action at the common law, againſt the executor. And then what is the cauſe, that a creditor way reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his debt, and that a legator cannot recover his legacie, in the kings Court, but only, for that remedie could not bee given unto legatories complaynants, by any writ out of the Chancery. And therefore that <note place="margin">21 Ed. 1. ſtatute upon the writ of conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſuch plaintiffes, might not be deferred of their right, and remedie in ſuch caſes, to their great dammage, it hath pleaſed the kings, by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, to tolerate the Church Officers to determine theſe caſes. Wherfore if it might pleaſe the king, to cauſe writs to be made out of his Court of Chancerie, for the recovery of Legacies, it were cleare by the Common Law of the Realme (as from the ſtatute may bee gathered) that the cognizance of theſe Caſes, did not appertaine any more to the Spirituall Court. For then might the legatorie, by that writ, bring an action againſt the Executor, to obtaine his Legacie. But how ſhould that action bee tryed? How? even as other actions of debt, detinue, or trover bee tryed, namely (as the caſe ſhould require) either by the countrey, or by the Judges upon a <hi>moratur in lege.</hi>

For if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtatute made by <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> that maidens and women, children of Noble men, and Gentlemen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being heires apparent <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and being left within age of ſixteene yeares, ſhould not marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the will or unknowing, of, or to the father, or againſt, &amp;c.

For if the King in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Courts, had the definition of all, as well as of ſome contracts, made by children, without conſent of parents, then ſhould a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of lewd and ungodly contracts, made by flatterie, trifling gifts, faire and goodly promiſes, of many unthrifty, and light perſonages thereunto wonne, by intreaty of perſons of lewd demeanour, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced voide, and of no efficacie, yea, and on the other ſide, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of honeſt, lawfull, and godly contracts, ſhould be confirmed, and <note place="margin">Much a doe in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Courts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio, &amp; acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For doth not their whole diſpute and information reſt principally, whether the contract be made by words of the preſent, or of the future tence? whether it be made with an oath, or without an oath? yea, and do they not exceedingly beſweat, and beſmyre themſelves, by turning and returning, by folding, and unfolding, their great and hydeous vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, for proofe, and reproof, of <hi>accipio, &amp; accipiam?</hi> yea and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

                  <p>Secondly, that every contract of mariage concluded, with conſent of parents, Tutor, Governour, or Gardian, ſhould be forcible and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, to bind both parties irrevocably: whether the ſame contract

                  <p>We are indeed of this judgement, that in regard of the Kings Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Office, theſe judgements of adulterie and other criminall Cauſes compriſed within this clauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought no more to be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, from the Kings temporall Courts, than matters of theft, murder, treaſon, and ſuch like ought to be. And for the maintenance of our judgements, we affirme, that there is no crime, or offence of what nature or qualitie ſoever, reſpecting any commandement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within either of the two tables, of the holy law of God, if the ſame be now corrigible by ſpirituall power, but that ſome fault and contempt, one, or other, of the like nature and qualitie, as compriſed under the ſame commandement, hath beene evermore, and is now pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by the Kings Regall, and temporall juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>For, adulterie, as the ſame is to be cenſured by penance in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Courts, ſo is raviſhment alſo, buggerie and ſodomie, to bee puniſhed in the Kings Court, by paine of death. And, as hath beene accuſtomed, that Ordinaries by cenſures of the Church, may correct fornicators, ſo fornication alſo, (as in ſome bookes written of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102527:32"/> law, is reported) hath beene in times paſſed, preſented, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in leets, and law-dayes, in divers parts of the Realme, by the name of <hi>Letherwhyte,</hi> which is, as the booke ſaith, an ancient Saxon terme. And the Lord of the Leet (where it hath beene preſented) hath ever had a fine, for the ſame offence. By the ſtatute of thoſe, that be borne beyond the ſeas, it appeareth, that the King hath cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, <note place="margin">25. Ed 3.</note> of ſome baſtardy. And now in moſt caſes of baſtardie, if not in all, by the ſtatute of <hi>Eliz.</hi> the reputed father, of a baſtard borne, is lyable to be puniſhed at the diſcretion of the juſtices of peace.</p>
                  <p>Touching perjurie, if a man loſe his action, by a falſe verdict, in plea <note place="margin">Perjurie if puniſhable, temporally in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, why not in all.</note> of land, he ſhall have an attaint, in the Kings Court, to puniſh the perjurie, and to reforme the falſitie. And by divers ſtatutes it appeareth, that the Kings temporall Officers, may puniſh perjurie committed in the Kings temporall Courts. And though it be true, that ſuch perjury as hath riſen upon cauſes, reputed ſpirituall, have beene in times paſt, puniſhed only by Eccleſiaſtical power and cenſures of the Church, yet hereupon it followeth not, that the perjurie it ſelfe, is a meere ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and not a temporall crime or matter, or that the ſame might not to be civily puniſhed.</p>

Yea further, the king and his <note place="margin">1 Eliz. c. 1.</note> parliament, with conſent of the Clergie, in their Convocation, hath power to determine what is hereſie, and what is not hereſie. If then it might pleaſe the king, to have it enacted by parliament, that they which opiniatively, and obſtinately, hold, defend, and publiſh, any opinions, which according to an Act of Parliament already made, have beene, or may be ordered, or adjudged to bee hereſies, ſhould bee he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes <note place="margin">If it pleaſe the King, heretikes may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and hereſies fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.</note> and felons, and their hereſies to be felonies, and that the ſame heretiks and felons, for the ſame their hereſies and felonies, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, convicted, and adjudged by the courſe of the common law, as other felons are, ſhould for the ſame their hereſies and felonies, ſuffer the paines of death: there is no doubt, but the King, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Soveraigne, and Regall Lawes, might powerfully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, reforme hereſies, without any ſuch ceremoniall forme, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall obſervance, or ſuperſtitious ſolemnitie, as by the order of the Canon Law, pretended to bee ſtill in force, have beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed.</p>

Howbeit, they doe not hereby intend, that the party offending, in any of theſe things, and by the Kings law puniſhable, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wholly bee exempted and freed from all cenſures of the Church.

Secondly, he hath offended, againſt two lawes, the law of God, and the law of the King. For the execution of which two lawes, there be two kinds of officers, of two ſeverall natures, the king for the one law, and the officers of the Church for the other law; and both theſe kindes of officers, have power given them, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102527:33"/> from God, to execute; the one, Kingly and temporall; the other paſtorall and ſpirituall power. And therefore we ſay, it ſtandeth with great reaſon, that the ſoule cauſing the body to ſinne, ſhould no more eſcape that puniſhment which is appointed for the ſoule, by the law of God, than the bodie ſhould eſcape that puniſhment which is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the body, by the law of the King: why then the officers of the Church, may meddle with matters appertaining to the Kings law, and what an indignitie to the King were that? To this we anſwer, that the officers of the Church in a ſeveral reſpect, and to a ſeveral end, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in one and the ſelfe ſame matter, wherein the king dealeth, may no more bee charged with dealing in matters appertaining to the Crowne, by the exerciſe of their ſpirituall ſword, than can the King be charged, with medling in the ſame matters, to meddle with matters pertaining to the ſoule, by the exerciſe of his temporall ſword. So that the ſpirituall power of the officers of our Saviour Chriſt, (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth only in binding and looſing of the ſouls of men) can not poſſibly, by any reaſon or good intendment, be conſtrued, now to be any more prejudiciall, to the Kings prerogative, or contrariant to the lawes of the Realme, than it hath beene heretofore: Becauſe uſurie, inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, and divers other crimes Eccleſiaſticall have not beene puniſhed only by Eccleſiaſticall correction, but alſo by corporall paine. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to take away this frivolous objection, we inſtantly pray, that the lawes of the Realme may ſtill keepe their due and ordinarie courſe, and that the Kings Scepter may retaine, that ancient and Royall eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which belongeth unto it: and that it may be ordered, by an irrecoverable law as followeth.</p>

                  <p>By a ſtatute 15. R. 2. c. 6. becauſe divers dammages and diſeaſes oftentimes had hapned, and daily did happen to the parochians of divers places, by the appropriation of benefices, of the ſame places, it was agreed and aſſented, that in every licence, from thenceforth to bee made in the Chancerie of appropriation of any pariſh Church, it ſhould be expreſly contained and compriſed, that the Dioceſan of the place, upon the appropriation of ſuch Churches, ſhould ordaine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the value of ſuch Churches, a convenient ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to be paid and diſtributed yearely of the fruits, and profits of the ſame Churches, by thoſe that ſhall have the ſame Churches in proper uſe and by their ſucceſſors, to the poore parochians of the ſame Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in aid of their living and ſuſtentation for ever; and alſo that the Vicar be well and ſufficiently endowed. By which ſtatute it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that every impropriation ought to be made by licence out of the Chancerie, that it ought to be made to the uſe of Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only, and not to the uſe of temporall perſons or patrons. Now then all ſuch pariſh Churches, as without licence of the king in his Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, have beene appropried to any Eccleſiaſticall perſon; and againe all ſuch pariſh Churches, as by licence of the King in his Chancerie, have beene appropried, to the uſe of lay perſons, they are not to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted mens lawfull poſſeſſions and heritages. Beſides this, as many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations, as whereupon the Dioceſan of the place, hath not ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to the value of ſuch Churches, a convenient ſumme of money to be paid, and diſtributed yearly of the fruits of the ſame Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the poore Parochians of the ſame Churches, in aid of their living and ſuſtentation for ever; yea and every Church alſo appropried, as whereunto a perpetuall Vicar is not ordained, canonically to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and inducted in the ſame, and which is not convenably endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to doe divine ſervice, and to inform the people, and to keepe hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalitie there, all and every ſuch Church and Churches (I ſay) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than thus appropried, by the law of the Realme (as it ſeemeth) are not mens lawfull poſſeſſions and inheritances: For by a Statute of king <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, every Church after the fifteene yeare of

For if by the appropriation it ſelf, or by the abuſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the poore parochians have beene defrauded of their yearely diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, or if no Vicars have beene Canonically inſtituted and inducted in the ſame, or if being inducted they have their endowments ſo ſmall, or ſo covetouſly kept back from them, as that they cannot ſufficiently maintaine themſelves, much leſſe keepe hoſpitalitie: then (as the Admonitor confeſſeth) there muſt needs be a lamentable abuſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations; and that therefore it is greatly to be wiſhed, that by ſome good ſtatute, it might be remedied.</p>
                  <p>And as thoſe Churches which are unlawfully appropried, are not the lawfull poſſeſſion and heritage, of the proprietaries, ſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide we affirme, that thoſe impropriations, which were made and reformed, according to the ſtatutes of <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. and <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. may well ſtand as mens lawfull poſſeſſions and heritages, even with thoſe things which are required to be planted and brought into the Church, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Admonitor hath written to the contrary. For we doe not hold that maintenance, muſt only and neceſſarily be provided for every Miniſter, by the paiment of tyths, oblations and other eccleſiaſtical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, belonging to Churches appropried or diſappropried. For there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no direct proof to be made out of the law of God, that Miniſters of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102527:35"/> the Goſpell, muſt only live upon tythes; the King and parliament, may well and competently enough, appoint convenable endowments for every Miniſter, without diſapproprying of any Church appropried. And therefore little cauſe had the Admonitor, to inſinuate the ruine of impropriations, upon the bringing in the diſcipline of our Saviour Chriſt, becauſe the ſame may be well planted, and yet to other not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted.

How (I ſay) doth it follow that they which deſire impropriations, to be reſtored to their priſtinate ſtate, ſhould withall enquire, to have the finding of Miniſters by Tythes, to bee aboliſhed? It ſeemeth therefore, that the Admonitor, ſo hee might bee talking, paſſed but a little what hee talked. For what a double talke is here? or to what purpoſe was this talke? Was it becauſe ſome men doe thinke, that the Miniſters, ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive tythes, for their reliefe and paines in the Miniſterie? Why then, let all men know, that we diſclaime ſuch ſome mens opinions. For we account all things, pertaining to this life, directly, or by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, not commanded, nor prohibited, by the holy and ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to be things indifferent, and that therefore we may uſe them or not uſe them, as the commoditie or incommoditie of the Church ſhall require. And therefore as we doe not affirme, that the maintenance of the Miniſters, muſt onely and neceſſarily bee levied out of tythes, oblations, and ſuch like, ſo alſo wee doe not deny, but that the tenth part of the increaſe of all our goods, by the authoritie of the King, and his lawes, may be alloted for their poſſeſſion and heritage: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our countrey, the ſame manner of payment being ſo ancient, and ſo agreeable to the manners, uſages and diſpoſition of our ſtate and people. Nay ſince the payment of tythes, for ſervice accompliſhed in the ſpirituall Sanctuarie, is correſpendent in the nature thereof, to the equitie of the Law of Moſes, for the Levites attendance about the earthly Tabernacle; and ſince alſo wee bee bound by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102527:35"/> of the Apoſtle, to make him that teacheth us in the word, to be partaker of all our goods, I ſee not (ſo Jewiſh and popiſh ceremonie, and ſuperſtition be avoided) but that this duetie, may as Chriſtianly be performed, by the payment of the tenth part of the increaſe of our corne, hay, wooll, lambe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by the eight, twelfth, twentieth, or any other part of our money and coine. By payment alſo of which tithes, the Miniſters at every ſeaſon, with every kinde of neceſſarie proviſion towards hoſpitalitie, might throughly be furniſhed, which many times they ſhall want, by reaſon of mens backwardneſſe, when collections of monie are to be made. But to ſpeake no more of this matter of tithes, we will return to the objection made againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall government, drawn from taking away impropriations, And herein we will not handle, whether the lawes whereby impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations do ſtand, as mens lawfull poſſeſſion and heritage muſt (as hee ſaith) bee taken away: but whether impropriations, now divided from the Miniſterie, and diſperſed into many ſeverall mens hands, and imployed to many uſes in the Common weal, may not in tract of time by ſome wholeſome law, be reduced, either wholly, or in part, to be the only lawfull poſſeſſions and inheritances for the Miniſters of the Goſpell, yea and that without any prejudice or dammage unto Prince, or people.</p>
                  <p>It is evident in the eyes of all, that the Churches now appropried, doe ſtand and remaine as the lawfull poſſeſſions and inheritances, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the King, or of the Nobles, or of the Knights, Equires, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and other temporall perſons: or of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, Deanes, Prebendaries, and other Eccleſiaſticall perſons, or of the Vniverſities, of the Colledges in the Vniverſities, of Collegiate and Cathedrall Churches, of Schools, Hoſpitals, Fraternities, and other bodies Politike, and Corporate.

And beſides, the reverend Biſhops, we hope, will grant, that the great Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall, <note place="margin">This may be proved by 15. R. 2. and 4. h. 4. c. 2. and is confeſſed by M, Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his perpet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, pag. 365. 366.</note> and Collegiate Churches, were not founded by the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, Nobles, and great men of the Realme, to the end, that thoſe great Churches, (as great Hawkes prey upon little foules) with their great ſteeples, ſhould eat and devoure the little ſteeples, or that with their great Quiers, they ſhould overthrow and juſtle downe the ſmall pulpits. And therefore we moſt humbly pray aide from the king, for the caſting of new claps to bee erected in the little pulpits, that hee would be pleaſed, to grant <hi>restitutiones in integrum,</hi> to all the little Churches, and that all impropriations, of all Parochiall Churches and benefices, now by ſpoliation, parcell of the revenues, of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deanes, Archdeacons, Prebendaries, and other Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perſons, reſtants within thoſe great Churches, may bee wholly reſtored to their ancient and originall uſe, according to the mindes and intents of the firſt Donors, and Patrons of the ſame parochiall and little Churches. For if (as Maſter <hi>Bilſon</hi> ſaith) it bee true, that the Lords of Villages, having erected Churches, and allotted out portions for divine ſervice, either by Gods or mans law, by their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grants could not have the former rights, unto their patronages o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne; and if the allowance given at the firſt, to the Miniſter of each Pariſh, by the Lord of the ſoyle, were matter enough in the judgement of Chriſts Church, to eſtabliſh the rights of patrons, that they alone ſhould preſent Clerkes, becauſe they alone provided for them, if (I ſay) this be true, then have the Miniſters of thoſe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and of that ſoyle, juſt cauſe to require, at the Dioceſans hands, a reſtitution of ſuch allowances, as were firſt given and provided for them by the patrons: Eſpecially the Dioceſans by their owne act now enjoying, and converting the ſame allowances, to their own uſe. If it be anſwered, that this can not well and conveniently be brought to paſſe, becauſe the ſame impropriations, by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Biſhops, and other Eccleſiaſticall perſons, for diverſe ſummes of money, are now lawfully demiſed to farme, for many yeares yet to come: hereunto we anſwer, that theſe leaſes ſhould hinder nothing at
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102527:36"/> all, the reſtitution of the right and intereſt in reverſion, or remainder of thoſe impropriations. Only if the impropriations have beene made according to the lawes of the Realm, and the leaſes duly granted) theſe leaſes for a time, may hinder the incumbent Miniſters, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion of the Tithes, Fruits, and glebe Land, belonging to the ſaid impropriations. And yet may not the incumbent Miniſters, bee hindered in the meane while, from receiving the rents reſerved upon ſuch Leaſes, and which by the ſame Leaſes, are now payable to the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other Eccleſiaſticall perſons. Neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the determination of the ſame leaſes, ſhould the incumbent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, be any more letted, to enjoy and receive, the whole profits in right of their Churches, than other Miniſters be now letted to enjoy theirs. If any ſhall ſay, that many of theſe impropriations, are annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and appropried, as Prebends for the proviſion of ſome of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries of the ſame great Churches, and that the ſame Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in the right of their Prebends, bee the lawfull Rectors of the Churches appropried, and have <hi>curam animarum</hi> in the ſame Pariſhes; then we muſt inſtantly againe pray the King, that thoſe Prebendaries, by ſome wholeſome law may be conſtrained to reſide, and to incumb upon their ſaid Prebends, and Parochiall Churches, and that by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall preaching of wholeſome doctrine, they may endeavour to cure the ſoules of the people, over whom, by the order of thoſe great Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they be ſet, and over whom they have taken charge. And withall that they may no more be ſuffered, to ly and to live idely in their Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in their caves, and in their dens, ſometimes at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at <hi>Hereford,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Salisburie,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Southwell,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Windſore,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Pauls,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at <hi>Cambridge.</hi> When in the meane while both ſeldome, and very ſlenderly, they feed other ſheep, whoſe fleeces they take in, and about <hi>London, Wincheſter, Tukesbury, Reading,</hi> and other places of the Countrey.

If it be alledged that the king now having firſt fruits, Tenths, and Subſidies, out of the impropriations of thoſe great Churches, as being all compriſed, under a groſſe ſumme of the Tenths payable for the whole revenues of the ſame Churches, ſhould loſe the firſt fruits, Tenths, and Subſidies, of the ſame impropriations, if hereafter they become either donative, or preſentative; to this the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

                  <p>In the next ranke cometh commutation to be ſpoken of.

                  <p>The reaſons whereof may be ſuch as follow.</p>

The commutation then whereof we ſpeake, and which wee moſt humbly commend, to the conſideration of the King, is, <hi>viz.</hi> That parcell of the temporall Lands and poſſeſſions of Archbiſhops and Biſhops, together with all the lands and poſſeſſions, ſerving to the maintenance of idle Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and idle Songſters, in Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches (the Collegiate Churches of <hi>Eaton</hi> and <hi>Winchester,</hi> and the Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches in <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> excepted) by an equall and reaſonable proportion, may be made, with ſuch impropriations, as belong to the King, the Nobles, Commons, Colledges, Hoſpitals, Schooles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Provided as before hath beene ſaid, that there may be a liberall and convenable endowment, for the learned Biſhops or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, to be continued and placed in all the chiefe and principall towns and cities of the Realm.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102527:38"/> honeſtly might have imploied both their Latine and their labour, than lately they did. When by drawing Letters (as they pretended) congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatorie to the King, only in the name of Preaching Miniſters, they procured notwithſtanding ignorant, and unpreaching Miniſters to joyne in the action, and to affixe their hands and names. That ſuch let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have beene made and ſigned, is ſufficiently to be proved, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have beene preſented to the Kings hands, is not yet knowne.

                  <p>The third means to reduce impropriations, unto the poſſeſſion of <note place="margin">Publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations.</note> the Miniſterie is by way of publike redemption or purchaſe. For the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment whereof it is neceſſarie, that not only a common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be provided, but alſo that the price of improptiations, by a publike conſent be valued, at a reaſonable rate to make, which rate will bee a matter of ſmall weight, whether they bee valued to bee bought and ſold, at their old and ancient, or at their new and improved rents. To provide a common treaſure, though to ſome it may ſeeme a matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, and troubleſome, yet ſeeing the ſame poſſibly and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently may be done, there is no cauſe, that men ſhould faint, before thy fight, or be at an end, before they begin. It is written that the cauſe when king <hi>Solomon</hi> raiſed the tribute, to wit, was to build the houſe of the Lord, his own houſe and <hi>Millo,</hi> and the wall of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> After <note place="margin">1 Kin. 9. 15</note> that wicked <hi>Athaliah</hi> and her children, had broken up the houſe of God, and had beſtowed all the things, that were dedicate for the houſe <note place="margin">2 Chr. 24.</note> of the Lord, upon <hi>Balaam,</hi> King <hi>Ioaſh</hi> commanded the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, to go unto the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> to gather of all <hi>Jſrael</hi> money to repaire the houſe of God, from yeare to yeare, and they made a cheſt, and made Proclamation to bring the tax of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rejoyced, and brought in, and caſt into the cheſt. And when there was much ſilver, they emptied the cheſt, and carried it, to his place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and thus day by day they gather ſilver in abundance. If then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the building of an earthly houſe, the Princes and people of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> willingly with joy of their hearts, from yeare to year, and from day to day, threw ſilver in abundance into the cheſt, how much more were it praiſe worthy, if Chriſtian people, did encourage themſelves, to pay a ſmal tribute towards the proviſion of a competent maintenance, for their ſpirituall paſtours, by whoſe labours, as lively ſtones, they might be builded up into a ſpirituall temple in the Lord?
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102527:38"/> That many and great taxes and tributes of late yeares have beene made for many uſes, and to many purpoſes, there is no man ignorant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And therefore though there be little reaſon, that the people ſtanding already burdned, with great charge, ſhould be againe recharged, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when without any extraordinarie burthen, there is an ordinarie meanes, (if the ſame were accordingly beſtowed) by the people yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to relieve the Miniſters in all places, with a decent and comely portion; yet notwithſtanding to be eaſed, from thoſe publike payments, and annuall grievances, impoſed by the Eccleſiaſticall Courts, upon the people is not to be doubted, but the pariſhioners in all places would willingly pay any reaſonable tax or tribute, to be demanded of them for this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>An other meanes to raiſe this publike treaſure, may be a diſſolution <note place="margin">The diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Chappels may bee a good mean to raiſe a tribute.</note> of all free Chappels, and Chappels of eaſe in the Countrey, together with an union of two or moe Churches into one, eſpecially in Cities and great townes. For as in theſe Cities and Townes, the pooreſt, and meaneſt livings bee provided, ſo generally for the moſt part, are they fitted, with the pooreſt, and meaneſt Curates, as by moſt lamentable experience is to be ſeene, in all the Epiſcopall Cities of the Realme, excepting <hi>London.</hi> Nay the chiefe and Metropolitane Citie of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> is not to be excepted. For in that Citie there being about 12, or 13, Pariſh Churches, there hath not beene ordinarilie of late yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 3. or 4. able Preachers, placed in the ſame Churches.</p>
                  <p>The Chappels to be diſſolved, and the Churches to be conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated by two, and two into one, and one can be no fewer in number than one thouſand at the leaſt. All which if they might be ſold, the money to be raiſed upon their ſale, could bee no leſſe than twentie thouſand pounds, if they were ſold only for twentie pounds a peece. But if they be well worth double or treble ſo much, then would the treaſure alſo be double or treble. This diſſolution of Chappels, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Churches, is no new device, nor ſtrange innovation: but hath beene heretofore thought upon, and in ſome part confirmed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie by our Kings in their Parliaments.

And thus much of the meanes whereby ſome impropriations, may wholly be reduced to the uſe of the Miniſterie.

Wherein theſe two things come principally to be conſidered.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, whether it were not convenient to have it enacted, by the ſame law, that all and every impropried Church and Churches, with their glebes, tythes and other fruits, after the determination of the leaſes now in being, ſhould bee demiſed and ſet to farme, onely to the incumbent Miniſters of the ſame Churches, for terme of their naturall lives, if ſo long they did continue reſiant, and faithfully preach in the ſame Churches, the doctrine of the Goſpell, according to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, concerning Faith and Sacraments; by publike authoritie, now eſtabliſhed in the Church of England. And becauſe by likelihood the Vicars will not be able to pay fynes or incomes unto the Colledges, Hoſpitals, and other places, and becauſe alſo it ſeemeth reaſonable, that the Colledges, Hoſpitalls, and other places, by ſome other meanes, ſhould be recompenced, wee leave it againe to be conſidered, whether it were not convenient that the Vicars, in conſideration of non payment of fynes, ſhould yeeld in money, corn, or other proviſion, to the double or treble value, of the ancient and unimproved rents. For men experienced in theſe affaires of this life, know that the profits ariſing out of Churches appropried unto the farmours thereof, are commonly ſix, eight, or ten times more worth by juſt eſtimation, than are the old rents, payable unto Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Hoſpitalls, and other like places. And thus wee ſee how to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the bringing in of theſe things, which are required to bee planted in the Church, impropriations may ſtand, as mens lawfull poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and heritages, or otherwiſe how without damage or hurt to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102527:41"/> the King or Realme, they may be converted to the uſe and proviſion of the Miniſters, whatſoever hath beene inſinuated by the Admonitor to the contrary. And yet doe I not in any of theſe things, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, firſt or laſt, ſpoken, or to be ſpoken, deſire mine owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and judgement ſo to be reſpected, as though I ſhould arrogate unto my ſelfe more knowledge than all others, which labour in the cauſe of reformation: but onely I ſubmit theſe my private meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with their reaſons, to the cenſures of all wiſe, godly, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men. Humbly praying them ſo to beſtirre their owne wits, and ſo to beſtow their owne cunning, and learning, that a better and more eaſier way, by their ingenuouſneſſe, may be found out, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to take place. And in the meane ſeaſon, that theſe motions ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to their views, may not altogether be neglected, but duely wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conſidered. Eſpecially for that I have not tendered any other thing to be performed, by any of theſe meanes, unto any other, than ſuch as whereunto I my ſelfe to my power, yea and beyond my power as far as in me lyeth, ſhall be ready to yeeld.</p>
                  <p>And howſoever the Biſhops and other great Clergie Maſters, with their ſtately favourites, may pretend ſome part of this device, to bee an hinderance of learning, and other ſome part not to be for the Kings profit; yet to the firſt we anſwer briefly, that learning is not ſo much furthered by a few great rewards, provided for a few great learned men, as it is by many good rewards, appointed for many good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, as hereafter more at large, in a more convenient place is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Touching the Kings profit, we affirme, that it is not only moſt profitable, but alſo moſt honourable for the King, to have a multitude of loyall, vertuous, and godly ſubjects. And that ſuch manner of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, can by no meanes better bee procured, than by a continuall preaching Miniſterie of the Word, to be planted in every pariſh, of the Kings Realmes. And becauſe no man better knoweth the recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall duties, betweene a Chriſtian King, and Chriſtian Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, we leave the diſcerning of the ſpirits of theſe profit preachers to the tryall and judgement of the moſt Chriſtian King; whom if hee ſhall finde, either by flatterie, to fawne upon the Kings profit, or by labouring to keepe the King in a good opinion of things amiſſe, wee moſt humbly beſeech the King to accept them, and reward them for ſuch, as could wiſh in their hearts, the king ſhould rather bee impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by having many bad, and unprofitable ſubjects, than that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would not be inriched, by enjoying many good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impropriations. As for the Lawes whereby patronages do ſtand, as mens lawfull poſſeſſions, and inheritances, which (as the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

I will <note place="margin">The bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the diſcipline by paſtours and elders is not the leaving out of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any one of the three eſtates</note> take his meaning to bee, that the ſtatute lawes of England, to this day have ſtood by authoritie of the three eſtates, which to alter now by leaving out the one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then hereunto, I anſwer, that not any one of the three eſtates ſhould be left out, or barred, from having authoritie in making and promulging ſtatute lawes, though the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, by Paſtors and Elders were brought in. For we which ſo much cry (as he ſaith) for this manner of government, to be planted, are ſo farre from exempting, or excluding any one of the three eſtates, from their ancient power, priviledge, and preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, in the making of ſtatute lawes, as that wee pronounce him to be guilty of high treaſon, to the King and to the Realme, that avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the contrary. And we affirme directly, and confeſſe plainly, that it belongeth only, wholly and altogether, to the three eſtates, as well to roote out, and to pull up, whatſoever government, is not juſtifiable, by the holy law of God: as alſo to plant and to ſettle, whatſoever diſcipline is warrantable by the ſame law. And to ſpeak as the thing is, how were it poſſible to have the diſcipline by Paſtors and Elders plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by authoritie of the three eſtates, if one of the three eſtates ſhould be left out? or can it be imagined, that any one of the three eſtates, would ever conſent, to the bringing in of ſuch a government of the Church, as whereby (the ſame governement being once brought in) the ſame eſtate, ſhould ever after wards ceaſe, to be any more an eſtate?
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102527:42"/> Beſides we acknowledge that all powers are of God, and therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of the three eſtetes, being a power; we grant that the ſame hath his ſtateſhip, by the authoritie of God. And if all the three eſtates be lawfull by the holy law of God; how can it bee verified againſt us, that we, which urge the ſame holy law, for the bringing in of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline by paſtors and elders, ſhould notwithſtanding contrary to the ſame law, intend the leaving out, or altering any one of the three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates? But which of the three eſtates was it that he meant, ſhould bee left out? I trow there is none of the ſtate of prelacie, ſo ill adviſed, as to take upon him the proof of this poſition: <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lords ſpiritual <note place="margin">The ſtate of the prelacie is not one of the three eſtates in parliament.</note> by themſelves alone, doe make one of the three eſtates, or that the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of England, to this day have ſtood by their authorities, as by the authoritie of thoſe, who alone by themſelvs are to be accompted, one of the three eſtates. For if that were ſo, how much more then, might the great Peeres, Nobles, and temporall Lords, challenge to make by themſelvs an other eſtate? And without contradiction, to this day the commons ſummoned by the kings writ, have ever been reckoned a third eſtate. Now then if ſtatutes have hitherto ſtood, by authoritie of the Lords ſpirituall, as of the firſt eſtate, by the authoritie of the Lords temporall, as of the ſecond eſtate, and by authoritie of the commons, as of the third eſtate, I would gladly be reſolved, what accompt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitor made of the Kings eſtate. It had not beene liegnes, nor loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (I am ſure) howſoever hee ſpake much of the Lords ſpiritualls du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and fidelitie in the execution of our late Queenes lawes, to have ſet her Royall perſon, authoritie and ſtate, behind the lobbie, at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament doore, Either the kings Royall perſon then, as not compriſed within the compaſſe, and circumcription of the three eſtates, by his meaning (which had beene but a very bad meaning) muſt be thought to have beene hitherto ſecluded, from authorizing the ſtatute lawes, made in Parliament. Or els it is a moſt cleare caſe, that the Lords ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall themſelves alone, do not make any one of the three eſtates. And what matter then of more weight, may it happily ſeeme to be, to alter the authoritie of the Lords ſpirituall, and to leave them out of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, when as notwithſtanding, they being left out, the ſtatutes of England, may remaine and continue, by authoritie of the three eſtates? And it were not amiſſe for the Lords ſpirituall, to conſider, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and ſtate of the weale publike, both now is and ever hath beene, a perfect, entire and complete bodie, and State, without the bodie and ſtate of Prelacie: and that the King, and Nobles, and Commons of the Realme, without Prelates, Biſhops or Clerkes, doe make up all the members and parts of the bodie, and of the ſtate; and may therefore

As by an Act made in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, is plainly to be ſeene. For whereas the King by aſſent of the Prelates, Earles, <hi>&amp;c</hi> had willed and granted for him, and for his heires, certaine articles firmly to be kept, and holden for ever, namely that the Miniſters of holy Church for money taken for redemption of corporall penance, nor for proofe, and accompt of Teſtaments, nor for ſolemnitie of Mariage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould not be impeached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the Kings Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices; nevertheleſſe the ſame king, in the ſame yeare, with aſſent of the Earls, Barons, and other wiſe men of the Realme, and without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Prelates, revoked and adnulied the ſame articles againe.</p>

And the like proteſtation being made by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Clergie, at a Parliament, holden the third yeare of the ſame king, it was replyed for the king, that neither for their ſaid proteſtta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">The king bound by his oath, to do his laws to be made though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt him.</note> or other words in that behalfe, the king would not ſtay to grant to his Juſtices in that caſe, and all other caſes, as was uſed to be done in times paſt, and as he was bound, by vertue of his oath at his corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Where it is to be noted (ſaith hee) that at the grant hereof, the conſent of the Biſhops is neither named nor expreſſed, with the Lords of Parliament, and yet the Parliament ſtandeth in his full force notwithſtanding. At an other Parliament <note place="margin">Act. &amp; Mo. 525.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>William Wicham,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> for a ſlanderous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſavouring of a contumelious lye, and proceeding of a ſubtile zeale, meaning falſhood, was ſo by the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> purſued, that by act of Parliament he was condemned, and deprived of all his temporall goods. And this ſeemeth to have beene done (ſaith Maſter <hi>Fox)</hi> without aſſent, and againſt the wills of the Lords ſpirituall; for afterward at an other Parliament, great ſuite was made by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, for deliverance of the ſaid Biſhop: and being asked a ſubſidie in the Kings behalfe, with great lamentation they complained, for lacke of their fellow and brother of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and denyed to joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any tractation of any ſuch matter. And in another Parliament holden at <hi>Yorke,</hi> in the ſixth yeare of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, all ſuch <note place="margin">Act. &amp; Mo. 519.</note> lawes, as then paſſed, and were concluded by the King, Barons, and Commons, were good, notwithſtanding the abſence, or malice of the Lords Spirituall. For it is recorded (ſaith he) that onely the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and the Abbots of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Silby</hi> were there preſent.</p>
                  <p>In a booke intituled the burning of Pauls Church in <hi>London,</hi> 1561. and in the fift queſtion moved by a papiſt, it is ſaid, <hi>that this manner of ministration of Sacraments, ſet forth in the booke of Common prayers, was never allowed, nor agreed upon, &amp;c.</hi> no not by the Clergie of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, at the laſt Parliament, but only it was agreed upon, by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie which had nothing a doe with ſpirituall matters, or cauſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

                     <hi>Dureſme</hi> anſwering: was there not (ſaith he) a diſputation for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, appointed by the Queenes Majeſtie, wherein your Clergie was affraid to utter their fooliſhneſſe, in defending their ſuperſtition, leſt they had taken more ſhame in anſwering, than they did in holding their peace? I thinke the Vniverſities with ſo many places of this
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102527:44"/> Realme, receiving religion, and theſe other diſputing for it, may bee counted to be ſome part of the clergie of the Realme. And ſo it was not received without conſent of the Clergie: But theſe were not of the Parliament, What then? But as <hi>Ioaſh, Joſaphat, Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Ioſias,</hi> did not make a new Religion, but reſtored that which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced and had long lyen buried, ſo our Parliament, did not ſet forth a new religion, but reſtore that, which was godly begun before the good K. <hi>Edward,</hi> confirmed by the Parliament, and Clergie then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But nothing can bee concluded, as a law by Parliament, (ſay they) without conſent of the Clergie there preſent. But this having not their conſent, cannot be counted a law, as they think. I had rather (ſaith M. <hi>Pilkington)</hi> leave this to be anſwered by the Lawyers, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Yet that the world may ſee, that ſomething may be ſaid in it, we grant him not this to be true, that no law at all can be made without conſent of Biſhops. Look your old ſtatutes of Parliament, when Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were higheſt, afore <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and ye ſhall read, that they paſſed by conſent of the Lords temporall, and commons, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mention of the Lords ſpirituall, which ſtatutes, many of them ſtand in ſtrength at this day. Then it may well be gathered, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Clergie, was not alwayes ſo neceſſarie as they thinke it. The Lawyers, Judges, and Juſticers put in practice and execute theſe lawes, therefore their doings, may be a ſufficient reaſon, to lead the unlearned, what opinion they have of this ſtatutes. For Religion (except Juſtice <hi>Raſtall)</hi> firſt executing that, and afterward running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, may condemne the reſt, which I truſt he may not; I thinke they would not execute them, except they had the ſtrength and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of lawes. If they doe contrary to their knowledge and opinion, they cannot be able to anſwer their doings, but I think no wiſe men are of this opinion. Only theſe corner creepers, that dare not ſhew their face, and would deceive the people, go about to deface all good and godly order, that diſpleaſes them. In the dayes of K. <hi>Edward,</hi> they had the like fond opinion, that the king could not make lawes in his minoritie, untill he came unto full age, and to make the people to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey their Prince. Hitherto M. <hi>Pilkington</hi> L. Biſhop of <hi>Duriſme;</hi> with whom the moſt worthy and learned M. <hi>Jewell,</hi> late Biſhop of <note place="margin">M.

                  <p>The wiſe and learned (faith hee) could have told you, that in the Parliaments of England, matters have evermore uſed to paſſe, not of neceſſitie by the ſpeciall conſent of the Archbiſhops and Biſhops, as if without them no ſtatute might lawfully be enacted, but only by the more part of voyces, yea although the Archbiſhops and Biſhops were
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102527:45"/> never ſo earneſtly bent againſt it. And ſtatutes ſo paſſing in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, onely by the voyces of the Lords temporall, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and agreement of the Lords ſpirituall, have nevertheleſſe beene alwayes confirmed, and ratified by the Royall aſſent of the Prince, and have beene enacted and publiſhed, under the names of the Lords ſpirituall and temporall. Reade (ſaith hee) the ſtatutes of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the firſt, there ſhall ye find, that in a Parliament holden at S. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundſbury,</hi> the Archb. and Biſhops were quite ſhut forth, and yet the Parliament held on and good, and profitable lawes were there enacted, the departing, or abſence, or malice of the Biſhops ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall notwithſtanding. In the Records thereof it is written thus: <hi>Habito Rex cum ſuis Baronibus Parliamento, &amp; Clero excluſo ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt:</hi> The King keeping a Parliament, with his Barons, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, that is to ſay, the Archbiſhops and Biſhops being ſhut forth, it was enacted, <hi>&amp;c.

And what booteth it, then, to have a double or treble conſultation, and conſent of Archbishops and Bishops in parliament?

                  <p>This argument ſeemeth to be drawne from kitchin profit, and is but a bugbegger to ſcarre covetous men from ſubmitting their necks unto the yoke of that holy diſcipline, which our Saviour Chriſt hath preſcribed, and which the Admonitor himſelfe confeſſeth, to have beene practiſed by the Apoſtles, and primitive Church. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this argument ſeemeth to lay a very heavie burden on mens ſhoulders, ſuch as is impoſſible to be borne, it is an argument worthy <note place="margin">That ſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and Deacons ſhould bee found at the charge of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</note> to be examined, though in it ſelf, the ſame be very untrue and abſurd. For who did ever fancy that a Paſtor, a company of Seniours, and a Deacon or two at the leaſt, ſhould be men of occupations, or that they ſhould be all found of the pariſh, becauſe they muſt leave their occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, to attend upon the matters of the Church? Why? there be many hundreds of pariſhes in England, wherein there dwelleth not one man of an occupation. And what reaſon then, or what likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102527:47"/> of reaſon was there, to father ſuch an abſurd neceſſitie upon the Church? As for the neceſſitie of having one Paſtour in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pariſh, and of his finding by the pariſh, becauſe it is his duety, to attend upon reading, exhortation, and doctrine, although he bee no man of occupation, this (I ſay) is agreeable and conſonant, to the government of the Church practiſed by the biſhops. And therefore in the finding, and having of one paſtour in every pariſh, they, and wee differ not. But that men of occupations only ſhould be choſen Seniors and Deacons in every pariſh; or if Seniours and Deacons, were men of occupations in any pariſh, that they ſhould be all found of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, we utterly diſclaime as an abſurditie of abſurdities. And yet wee deny not, but in Cities and great townes wherein for the moſt part, men of trade, doe inhabit, that Seniours and Deacons muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie be men of occupations. Vnleſſe then an occupation muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie hinder men, from being faithfull, religious, and godly men, there is no reaſon to inforce, that men of occupations in cities and <note place="margin">What kind of men ought to be choſen ſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and Deacons.</note> great towns, ſhould not be choſen Seniours and Deacons. And as for Countrey pariſhes, wherein very few, or no men of occupations doe reſide, this objection is altogether idle. In which pariſhes alſo we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that men of greateſt gravitie, integrity, wiſedome, faith and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, ought to be choſen Seniours, and Deacons. And wee doubt not, but all ſuch men as whom we intend, ought to bee choſen Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and Deacons, whether dwelling in Cities and Townes, or in the Countrey, would be as ready, as willing, and as watchfull, prudently to imploy themſelves hereafter, in matters of the Church, as now either themſelves, or their equals, are buſied in matters of their corporations, or common weal, without any manner of contribution, to be yeelded towards their finding.</p>
                  <p>When the people of Iſrael were commanded to pay their tythes, firſt fruites, and other oblations unto the Prieſts, and Levites, for their attendance and ſervice in the Sanctuary, we do not read in the whole book of God, that they were injoyned to be helpers and contributers to the reliefe and ſuſtentation of the Captaines over thouſands, of the Captaines over hundreds, nor of the Elders and governours, placed ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by citie, for the affaires of the King. And therefore ſithence wee have neither precept nor preſident, that all the officers of the Church ſhould be found at the coſts of the Church; and ſithence alſo as well in Countrey pariſhes, as in Cities, and townes, (to the praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God be it ſpoken) wee have many able, wealthy, and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall perſons, who have given their names unto Chriſt, what neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is there that any ſuch Seniours and Deacons ſhould bee elected,

Afterward let the Miniſter going a part, with ſome of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102527:48"/> Elders, take counſell, how the others (whoſe manners are ſaid to be lewd, and whoſe life is ſaid to be full of miſchieſe) may firſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the commandement of Chriſt in the Goſpell, come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and be communed with, by ſober and diſcreet men, and with a certaine kinde of brotherly love.

And when the force and vehemency of excommunication ſhall bee ſhaken, firſt let the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop be ſought unto, who if hee ſhall conſent, and oppoſe his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, let the forme of excommunication bee diſpatched, before the whole Church, that we may bring in as much as may be the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>Thus much have theſe moſt Chriſtian Diſciplinarians, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ancient Diſcipline, by Paſtours, Elders, and Deacons both written and ſpoken. And yet have they founded never a word, to the finding of Elders and Deacons by the Pariſh, nor by having men of occupations to leave their buſineſſe, to attend upon matters of the Church. For men thus meeting together once only in the week, and that upon the Lords day, and that only within their own pariſhes, and without payment of any fees, may very wel notwithſtanding theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendances, give themſelves wholly all the weeke following, to their ordinary vocations.

It ſeemeth alſo to be equall for many ages paſt that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> might have ſupreme and abſolute power over all perſons, ſtates, and cauſes, not onely in <hi>Rome, Italy, Spaine, Germany,</hi> and other forraigne kingdomes, but alſo in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> But as yet to the view of all the world, it hath not proved perillous for the King and Queene of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to eſtablish new laws, for the alteration of that ancient abuſe. And why hath it not been dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſo to do? Why? forſooth becauſe there was evident utility in doing of it. But how could an evident utilitie appeare before it was done? How? Forſooth becauſe the holy law of God had warranted an alteration. For faith having eyes to ſee the wiſedome, the power, and the truth of God in his word, diſcerned a far off that the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords Supper, was long before the ſacrifice of the maſſe. And therefore our Kings by abandoning poperie out of the Realme, did not inſtitute any new religion, but onely they reſtored the old. Now then if a ſame holy law of God, do condemn the choice, and thruſting of the paſtour upon the people by one man alone; and again it the ſame Law, doe impugne the primacie of one paſtour over all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102527:49"/> Paſtours, as well in a Dioceſſe, or Province, as in the whole Weſt part of Chriſtendome, what danger can it be, not to disfranchiſe the one, ſithence without any manner of danger, we have aboliſhed the other? or what perill can it be, not to countenance the ſonnes, ſithence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perill we have diſcountenanced the father? Eſpecially ſeeing in this place of the admonition wee have a plaine confeſſion, that the common manner of election of Paſtors, Elders, and Deacons in the old Churches was made by the people. For if the examples of ſchiſm, diſcord and contention, did commonly appeare in the old Churches, while that manner of election did continue, then by his owne mouth <note place="margin">Common manner of elections in the old churches was by the people.</note> that manner of election was common, and did continue in the old Churches.

For had it been ſimply lawfull for them, to have dealt in thoſe cauſes by the word of God, then aſwell before ſchiſme, diſcord, and diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as afterward, yea rather much more before than afterward.

For ſchiſme (ſaith he) cauſed them to intermeddle. So as by his confeſſion, they were but intermedlers, and entercommoners, by reaſon of ſchiſme, and not commoners, and medlers by vertue of Gods word. And yet now a dayes our reverend Bishops in this caſe, are no more intercommoners, with Princes and with the people, they ate no more entermedlers as in old times they were; but they have now ſo far incroached upon the prerogatives of the prince, and privileges of the people, that neither prince nor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have any commons in the election of Paſtors, Elders and Deacons with them at all.

But this effect, is therefore ſtill to bee continued, becauſe otherwiſe the cauſe would a new ſprout out, and ſpring up againe. Nay rather inaſmuch, as for theſe many yeares, we
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102527:50"/> have had ſchiſm, diſcord and diſſention, becauſe the biſhops wholly and altogether have medled in the choiſe of paſtours, and have thruſt upon the people, whatſoever paſtours pleaſe not the people, but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves, and have not ſuffered the people to meddle, no not ſo much as once to intermeddle in theſe matters; in as much (I ſay) as theſe things be ſo: it ſeemeth moſt expedient, requiſite, and neceſſary, for the appeaſing, and pacifying of this diſcord, and the taking away of this ſchiſm, to have the manner of election, which was in the old Churches, reſtored to the people; and this wherein the biſhops have intermedled, without authoritie from the word, to be aboliſhed: that ſo againe the cauſe of ſcbiſm and ſtrife, which is now among us cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the effect might likewiſe ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>After I had ended this tract, in this manner, touching this point, there came into mine hands a booke intituled, <hi>The perpetuall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts Church,</hi> written by <hi>Thomas Bilſon,</hi> Warden of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> Colledge: in the fifteenth chapter of which booke is handled this queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> to whom the election of Biſhops and Presbyters doth rightly belong, and whetherby Gods law the people muſt elect their paſtours or no. In which chapter alſo the matter of ſchiſm, ſtrife and contention is handled. The finall ſcope and concluſion whereof, is as the propoſition importeth, twofold: Firſt, concerning Biſhops, then concerning Paſtours. <hi>The quarrell taken againſt Biſhops doth not ſo much touch</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the office and functions of Biſhops, as it doth the Princes prerogative. When you rather thinke the Prince may not name her Biſhops, without the conſent and election of the people, you impugne not us, but directly call the Princes fact, and her lawes in queſtion.</hi> As touching this point of the propoſition, becauſe the people by any law, or cuſtome, never challenged any right, or intereſt, in the choiſe of the Kings biſhops, wee have nothing <note place="margin">The King only hath power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate his Kingly Bb.</note> to meddle or to make about the choiſe; of any of the Kings Biſhops. Nay we confeſſe, as his highneſſe progenitors Kings of England have beene the Soveraigne Donours, Founders, Lords and Avowes of all the Biſhopricks in England without aid of the people; that ſo likewiſe it is a right, and intereſt inveſted into his Imperiall crowne, that he only, his heires and ſucceſſors, without conſent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ought to have the free nomination, appointment, collation, inveſtiture, confirmation of all the Biſhops from time to time, to be planted in any of thoſe Biſhoprickes; yea, and wee ſay further, that the King alone, hath not power onely to nominate, collate and confirm, but alſo to tranſlate, yea and if it pleaſe him to depoſe all his Kingly Biſhops without any conſent of his people at all. For (ſay we)

No, no, our ſoules, and the ſoules of our wives, children and families ſhould be more dear, and more precious in our eyes, than that careleſly we would hazzard, all our birthrights, upon the skill and abilitie of ſuch a meſſe of hirelings, and idoll ſhepheards. And ſurely me thinkes it ſtandeth greatly with the charitie of our Lord Biſhops to conceive <note place="margin">Though the common people bee not able to diſcerne of paſtors, yet the Nobles are able.</note> the Commons, to have ſo much naturall underſtanding, as not to chooſe a cobler, when they want a carpenter; nor to retaine a loyterer in lieu of a labourer, nor to hire a ſleeper, in ſtead of a watchman. But (alas) be it, that the poore Commons of England, were thus wretched and thus bewitched; yea be it, that they were thus deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and beſides themſelves: ſhould therefore the Nobles and Peeres of the Realm; be as prophane, as impious, and as heatheniſh as they? Are the great men alſo unworthy, unable, and unfit to diſcerne between

Can they alſo put no difference betweene good and evill, betweene a blind guide, and him that hath his eye-ſight? or have they no better ſtomach, than to caſt up Mithridate, and to digeſt hemlocke? will they alſo chuſe them Captaines from among Corviſers? and will they call ſhepheards from among ſwineheards? or will they take them paſtours from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong pedlers? or will my Lords of the clergie charge them to bee thoſe ambitious perſons, to work the Commons, (for their private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) to the choiſe of unworthy men? or will they, being themſelvs under his Majeſtie, the worthies of the land) and chiefe guides and leaders of men in peace and in war upon earth, chuſe the ſcumm, the refuſe, and the baggage of the land, to guide their owne ſoules to hell? For to heaven by the labour and induſtrie of ſuch idoll mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (as whoſe lips preſerve no knowledge) they can never bee brought.

But (alas) is there any marvail, that the common people (for the moſt part) be backwardly affected?

Can truth ſpring from errour? or can light ariſe out of darkneſſe? Doe men pluck, or pull corne from a dead ſtalke, or a full eare from a dead root? Can a Vintener draw wine out of an emptie Caſque? or doth a Baker poure meale out of a bottomleſſe bag? If then the common people be fooliſh and ignorant, if they doe erre, and bee irreligious, they may juſtly challenge the Lords ſpirituall of unkindneſſe, and want of love, not becauſe they have ſent Embaſſadors unto them, as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> ſent unto <hi>Ioſua,</hi> with old ſackes, and old bottels, with old ſhooes, and old rayment; with proviſion of bread dried, and moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but becauſe they have ſent them ſuch ambaſſadors, as have had no ſackes, no bottels, no ſhooes, no raiment, yea and no manner of bread at all.

What? by them ſelves in one place ſitting round and cloſe together? Nay but in a thouſand and moe Pariſhes diſtant farre and wide aſunder, and that at ſundry times, one time long after another: and what a ſtrange and new kinde of feeding call you that?

And yet this is the common manner of Diet, and the common maner of food prepared and ſet before the ſoules of the people. For many of theſe learned Preachers, gallop from place to place, and trot from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh to pariſh, and give unto the people at one time, bread, half baked, at another time, beer half brewed; ſometimes either meat twice ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or halfe raw, and many times drinke, both dead, ſower, and wallowiſh. And how then is it poſſible, that the ſoules of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould proſper, wax ſtrong and bee plyable in going forward in the truth of religion, they being ſo thinly dicted, and entertained with ſo ſmall coſt. But let theſe gallopers paſſe, wee will conclude this point: and thus wee ſay, that the backwardneſſe of the people in the truth of religion (how backward ſoever they bee, and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſame backwardneſſe may happen) can bee no good plea in barre to take from the people of God, their right, intereſt and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from the allowance and approbation of their paſtour.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102527:59"/> of their purſes, nor ſo careles of their thrifts, as to jangle in vain, when before hand, they know there is no hope of gaine. And indeed what advantage, or what pleaſure ſhould Ancients divided againſt Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and chiefe men diſtracted againſt chiefe men in a pariſh, about the election of a Miniſter, reape by ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> diviſion, and diſtraction? Beſides by our daily experience, we have learned, that very rarely, or not at all about elections, made by the people of any Officers, either in the Countrey or in Cities and Townes, any variance or partiall ſuites have beene ſtirred, betweene the electors. For though ſome times perhaps they varie in their judgements one from another, yet reſt they more wiſe and provident, than to impaire their owne eſtate, to advance an other mans reputation. And if in former times there have no occaſion of partiall ſuites (touching publike officers in the common weale) fallen out betweene the people, when out of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude they have choſen one: much leſſe can there be any occaſion of <note place="margin">No partiall ſuites can be among pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when one only is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bee choſen by them.</note> partiall ſuites, if only there remaine but one, to bee choſen to bee a Church officer. For if all the ancients agree to chooſe that one, then is all the ſuit (about him) ended: and if the greater part diſagree, yet this their diſagreement can bee no occaſion to breed and nouriſh ſuit and contention. And why? firſt becauſe no other cauſe by the greater part ought to be alledged, to withdraw their conſent, but only ſuch a cauſe as the law ſhould preciſely allow, in the ſame caſe, to bee a juſt cauſe: Secondly, becauſe this juſt cauſe before the day of election, ought to be made knowne unto the Magiſtrate, and by him to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; ſo that if the greater part upon the day of election ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, not having before hand alleaged, and provided a juſt cauſe of their diſlike, the voices of the leſſer part (as being ſuppoſed the better part) ſhall prevaile, confirm, and make good the election. Oh! here is much (ſaid my Lords) ſpoken of a choice, and election to be made by the Miniſters and people, by proofes to bee made before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, but here is not any one word ſpoken, or any mention made of the Patron, of the Biſhop, or of the Archdeacon, of preſentation, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or induction. And what an alteration, and innovation would that be, and what a dangerous attempt were it, to alter lawes ſetled; and that Patrons ſhould bee curbed, and that Biſhops and Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons ſhould not meddle in theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As for ſtipendarie Curats it is expreſly againſt the policie of our Church, that any ſhould be ordained a Miniſter, to ſerve only as an hireling.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102527:65"/> places of learning. For if every place of miniſtration, be full, and none muſt be made a Miniſter untill ſome place be void, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſome patrons, upon good cauſes to be allowed by publike diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, might be permitted to nominate ſome Clerkes already placed in adminiſtrations: Yet in the end, as well the patrons of thoſe Churches, from whence theſe are to beremoved, as other patrons alſo (many benefices at one time being void) muſt of neceſſitie, ſeek out men, to be ordained, which never were ordained to the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie before.

But if all mens ſons in the Camp, and in the Court bee capable of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alike; if as well a labourers ſonne following the Cart, as a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Again, fathers doe not therefore ſend their ſons to be ſtudents, at the Innes of Court, or to be apprentiſes in the City of <hi>London,</hi> only in regard, that they may bee all great Citizens, and all great rich men, and all great Lawyers, and all Judges of the Land. It ſufficeth all parents, and the purpoſe and intent of all parents is, that their ſons being ſuch Lawyers, and ſuch Citizens as by their law, and by their trades, they may thrive, and live Barreſter-like, and Lawyer-like; Marchant-like, and Citizen-like, though they be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to live Serjeant-like, or Judge-like, Alderman-like, or Lord-like. In like ſort queſtionleſſe, would it be an excellent incouragement, to many fathers, to ſend many ſons unto many Schooles and Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of learning, if ſo be there were many and good rewards, rather than few and great rewards provided for many, rather than for few learned men in the Church. For if there be but few rewards, albeit the ſame be great, then but a few fathers among many, will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the ſpending of their ſubſtance, upon a vaine hope, that their ſons ſhall obtaine great rewards of learning. For what father know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the capacitie, and diligence of his ſo? Or who can divine that his ſon, ſhall be one among the number of a few men greatly learned, worthy of a great reward, and to live Deane-like, Archdeacon-like, Biſhop-like, or Archbiſhop-like?

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if by continuance in the Vniverſitie, profound knowledge, and ripeneſſe, be ſo neceſſarie, that (as is pretended) in reſpect thereof, a change of the Clergie may not be made, and that unlearned, and undiſcreet Miniſters, as it were by neceſſitie, ſhould ſtill bee placed; then ſeemeth it reaſonable, to move the L. Bb. that it would pleaſe them to effect an aboliſhment of ſome of the ſtatutes, of all the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge:</hi> whereby all Maſters of Art, of what youth, ignorance, or rudeneſſe ſoever they be (excepting ſome ſmall number, which by order of their foundation, he put apart to the ſtudie of Law or Phyſick) ſome after two, ſome after three, and ſome after foure years of their commencement, are compelled either to enter into the Miniſterie, or to leave their fellowſhips: Nay in ſome Colledges, if Bachelers of arts bee choſen fellows, and bee not Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters after one yeare, by ſtatute they loſe their places. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reaſon of the founders of all which ſtatutes (to my beſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) is this: namely that the harveſt being great, and the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers but few, many labourers, ſhall be ſent from thoſe Colledges, into the harveſt.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102527:70"/> of ripeneſſe ſhould be ſent. But it is ſimply provided, that many labourers, and not loiterers ſhould be ſent, and yet now the Admonitor rather than that ſome loiterers ſhould not be ſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to ſeclude ſome labourers from the worke.

                  <p>The Argument following which the Admonitor would ſeeme <note place="margin">Page 81.</note> to let paſſe, drawne from experience, is of like quality. For though experience (as hee ſaith) teach that men of ſtubbornneſſe, will not <note place="margin">By excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Paſtors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Elders, moe can not bee out of communion than in communion</note> ſhun the company of ſuch as bee excommunicated, and though ſuch men of ſtubbornneſſe, muſt be alſo (as he ſaith) excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, for keeping of company with them, yet to affirme, that by meanes of Paſtourly, and Elderly excommunication, moe will bee excommunicated, as being men of ſtubborneſſe, than in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102527:72"/> is a very groſſe, and palpable errour. For we hold (as the truth is) that the greater part of the Church cannot be excommunicated by the leſſer; nor that many ſhould be excommunicated, by a few; nor that a few ſhould bee excommunicated by one of the Church. And if the common union muſt neceſſarily conſiſt of all, or of the moſt part of the faithfull, then is the leſſer part alwayes out of this common union. For what elſe is excommunication, but <hi>extra communionem ejectio,</hi> a caſting forth of one, or of moe perſons from the common fellowſhip, ſociety, and company of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? The greateſt part whereof, and not the leaſt, are accompted to be the Church, and to be in communion; unleſſe then the whole Church, or the greater part of the Church, having once caſt out from among them, one or moe adulterers, blaſphemers, extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or ſuch like, and having alſo excommunicated men of ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe, for keeping company with ſuch, ſhall themſelves all, or the greateſt part, become children of diſobedience, and men of ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe: it can not be, but there muſt be ſtill moe of the Church, in communion, than out of communion. But if the whole Church ſhall have caſt away the yoke of Diſcipline, and become ſuch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as were thoſe whom before they had excommunicated, then is it a cleare caſe, that there is not any more, any communion among them. For how ſhould any common union be there, where is no union at all? And if all bee departed from obedience, where then can the Church bee? Nay further, if the greateſt part of the Church ſhould revolt, and forſake the faith, yet hereupon it would not follow, that moe of the faithfull, be out of communion, than in communion. For then ſuch onely as remaine in the unitie of faith, and have not ſeparated themſelves from Chriſt, remaine now only to bee in communion with Chriſt: out of which number alſo, if any ſhould be excommunicated, by the reſidue of their brethren, yet even among this ſmall number, there would be ſtill moe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, than out of communion. For to be out of communion can not be underſtood, to bee of any but onely of ſuch as remaining in the profeſſion of faith, and godlineſſe, are yet notwithſtanding found guiltie of ſome tranſgreſſion, and for the ſame by the Church, for a time cut off from the Church by ſentence of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe deformities, and inconveniences therefore, can in no wiſe follow, that Diſcipline of excommunication, by Paſtors, and Elders, which ſo much is called for. But certes, it fared (I feare mee) with the Admonitor, and ſundry of his colleagues in this caſe none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102527:72"/> than it fareth with incontinent women, once (ſay they) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent and ever incontinent, we know it by our ſelves. Our Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Judges and Officers, in like manner, ſeeing by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thoſe whom they account to be men of ſtubbornneſſe, not to ſhun the company of ſuch as they daily excommunicate; yea and <note place="margin">By the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moe are out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, than in communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his own reaſon, a deformed diſcipline.</note> they perceiving alſo, that it may fall out, that moe, under their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, may bee out of their communion than in communion with them, becauſe one man alone (as hee plainly inſinuateth) may excommunicate the greateſt part of the Church under his cenſure (for otherwiſe he could never have ſuppoſed, that moe would bee out of communion than in communion) becauſe (I ſay) theſe defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and theſe inconveniencies, by their owne experience, have beene found to have followed upon that diſcipline of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which hitherto hath been practiſed; it falleth out, that they cannot otherwiſe judge, but that all other manner of diſcipline, by excommunication, muſt be of the ſame nature and condition, that is, as deformed and inconvenient, as their owne is. And yet in this place it is worthy to be marked, what a rod the Admonitor hath <note place="margin">By S.

                  <p>
                     <hi>That diſcipline whereby moe will be, or moe may bee excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated than in communion, hath in it many deformities, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences:</hi>

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Major propoſition (if he ſpeake truly) is S. <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> but whether it be or be not, it is no great matter, becauſe it needeth not the authoritie of any man to confirm it, the ſame being ſound and true in it owne nature.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore there may be, or will bee more excommunicated, by their Lordſhips, their Archdeacons, Chancellours, &amp;c. than in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The aſſumption, though I cannot warrant the ſame to bee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply true, yet I may ſafely warrant it, to be drawne from the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors owne experience. For I let paſſe (ſaith he) that experience teacheth that men of ſtubbornneſſe, will not ſhun the company of them that be excommunicated, &amp;c. and that they muſt bee excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated <note place="margin">Biſhoply excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication hath many deformities</note> for keeping of company with them. And ſo it will fall out, that moe will be excommunicated, than in communion; but this laſt conſequence (ſay I) cannot follow, unleſſe he firſt preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe both his Antecedents to bee true: And therefore becauſe hee muſt needs be intended to have ſpoken of that kinde of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, whereof he hath had experience, it followeth that theſe deformities, and inconveniences whereof he ſpeaketh, muſt needs be found in that excommunication, which he and his uſe. For of the other kind of excommunication, hee never yet had any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And then by experience he could not ſpeake. If he ſpake not of his owne experience, but of the experience of ſome other men, then have we but little cauſe to believe him, becauſe we know not what manner of perſons thoſe were, from whom he drew his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of experience, and whether they reported deceitfully, or truly of their owne experience, or no.</p>
                  <p>And if this argument drawn from the experience of his owne manner of Diſcipline, be of ſufficient validitie to impugne (as he weaneth) that Diſcipline by excommunication; which ſo much (as he ſaith) is cryed for, and whereof as yet hee never had experience, <note place="margin">By diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoply ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation one may be a communitie</note> how much more effectuall then is this argument to overthrow that his owne manner of Diſcipline, which hee ſo long time to ſo ſmall profit, and with ſo great inconveniences, and deformities, hath ſo unprofitably practiſed? For can there bee any greater deformitie, than that one member ſhould be ſuppoſed to be the whole body, or that one man ſhould make a communitie? And yet this deformitie, by his experience, may fall out to be ſeen even under that diſcipline,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102527:73"/> which every Ordinarie exerciſeth. For if by proceſſe, <hi>Ex mero of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio,</hi> an Ordinarie ſhould excommunicate any one of his juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for not communicating with an idoll Miniſter, or for holding that Chriſt in his ſoule did not deſcend into hell, or for denying rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to be preaching, and withall ſhould pronounce all them to bee men of ſtubbornneſſe, which would ſhun the company of him ſo excommunicated. And for that cauſe alſo ſhould excommunicate them, as is here ſuppoſed lawfull to bee done, were it not a cleare caſe that the body of that Church muſt now bee taken to conſiſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the perſon of the Ordinarie, and one member to become the whole body? For if all under his juriſdiction were once excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, how could then any be in communion with him: And if they all were once excommunicated, muſt not the Ordinarie then alone be the common union, and ſo make a communitie? And what a deformed kind of excommunication, then is that kinde of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, whereby it may fall out, that to be one, is to be many, and that to be a Church, a companie, a ſocietie, and a fellowſhip, is to be one? of which nature, and of which kind that manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which by Paſtours and Elders is to bee executed, cannot be as hath already beene proved. If then excommunication now uſed bee a deformed kind of diſcipline, and therefore, as we ſay, to be no more tolerated, and if excommunication by Paſtours and Elders, be a kinde of diſcipline for the inconvenience thereof, (as he ſaith) not to be planted: what manner of diſcipline by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication <note place="margin">The Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor would have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at all</note> would he have in theſe dayes, trow we? would hee have none at all? verily I ſuppoſe none at all. For ſo doe his words plainly inſinuate, by two reaſons following: Firſt (ſaith he) the looſeneſſe of theſe dayes, require diſcipline of ſharper lawes by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of bodie, and danger of goods, which they do, and will more feare, than they will excommunication: Secondly, wee have (ſaith he) a good manner of diſcipline, by the Eccleſiaſticall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which doth much good, and would do more, if it were more common. But why did he not ſpeake plainly, and why did hee not affirme devoutly, that diſcipline by excommunication, was good where the Church was in perſecution, and that it is not neceſſarie, nor ſo convenient under a Chriſtian Magiſtrate as it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? For if Paſtors and Elders were appointed joynt officers, only for times of perſecution, and not to be under Chriſtian Princes, it followeth (theſe joynt officers ceaſing) that all acceſſories, appendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and conſequences, of their joynt offices muſt alſo ceaſe, unleſſe it can be proved out of the holy Scriptures, that the offices of Paſtours
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102527:74"/> ought ſtill to continue, and that the Offices of Elders ought not to continue; becauſe the offices of Elders, with all their appendices, have beene tranſlated by our Saviour Chriſt unto Archbiſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Archdeacons, their Chancellours, Commiſſaries, and Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. For unleſſe theſe Officers be Chriſts Officers, the diſcipline which they uſe cannot bind the conſciences of the people of God. And for this cauſe is it very probable, that he ſo commendeth diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of ſharper lawes, and diſcipline by the Eccleſiaſticall commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For if theſe officers, by their diſcipline have not to do with the conſciences of men, then is it no marvaile that men feare not their diſcipline. And therefore if they will be ſtill officers, it is requiſite, that they call for ſuch a diſcipline, as might cauſe men to ſtand in awe of their authoritie. But were they indeed the officers of God, and had they indeed the authoritie from God, to execute diſcipline by excommunication, as Paſtours and Elders did in the Primitive Church; then were the looſeneſſe of this age never ſo great, yet that the children of God in England would more fear the loſſe of goods, lands, bodies, or lives, than the cenſure of Gods officers is one of the Admonitors paradoxes. And here I appeale the conſciences of all the reverend Biſhops and Prelates in the land, and let them anſwer me hardly, if they judge themſelves to bee the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and had ſeven times ſeven thouſand lives, whether they had not rather ſeven thouſand times be committed to the Goaler of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> than once be delivered over, to the Goaler of Hell. And are not all the children of God in England their brethren? And are they not all led by one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit? And how then can they leſſe feare excommunication (which is a deliverie of the ſoule to Sathan) than the puniſhment of body and danger of goods? And yet touching this point of Excommunication, hee ſeemeth to be againſt himſelfe, for in the 137. page, he telleth us that happily it may be a fault, yea and a great fault that is found with the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in theſe dayes, that they doe not excommunicate the Prince and Rulers, and ſo conſtraine them to doe that, which by perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they will not doe. If then excommunication bee ſo terrible to Princes and Rulers, how ſhould it be of ſo light account with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? And if it be ſo powerfull as it can conſtraine Princes and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to doe their duties, how much more fearefull would it bee, to compell inferiours, and men of low eſtate, to live ſoberly in their vocations? I will not here debate the matter touching rhe excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Princes and Rulers; much leſſe touching the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Prince and Rulers of our land. But I would
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102527:74"/> gladly be informed, what they were, or who they be, that found great fault with the Biſhops in theſe dayes, for not endeavouring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the Prince and Governours?</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts, they thinke it ſufficient, that the Prince and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, be excommunicated by the Pope, and his Clergie. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and people profeſſing the Goſpell, and ſeeking for reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of excommunication, deny the Biſhops to have any divine power granted by the Word of God, to excommunicate a private man, much leſſe doe they thinke it lawfull for them to excommunicate the Prince and Rulers: Who then (I ſay) find fault with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, that they do not excommunicate the Prince and Governours, and ſo conſtraine them to do that which by perſwaſion they will not doe? For my part I cannot gheſſe, whom he ſhould meane, unleſſe he meant to give us to underſtand, that ſome Prelatiſts have conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about the excommunicating, both Prince and Governors, for not making ſharper Lawes, againſt ſuch, as whom the Prelates, and their favourites, have falſly ſlandered, to be peſtilent fellowes, movers of ſedition, enemies to Caeſar, troublers and ſubverters of the ſtate; <note place="margin">

And therefore to enforme the people of an Author, and not to bring him forth, it argueth and breadeth great ſuſpicion that <note place="margin">Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication toucheth them onely which make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to be of the Church.</note> the enformer was the Author himſelfe. Touching the looſeneſſe of ſome or of all in theſe dayes, that are without the Church, if hee intend that they require Diſcipline of ſharper Lawes, by puniſhment of body, and loſſe of goods, than excommunication, and that they will more feare that manner of puniſhment, I hold, and affirme therein as he holdeth, and affirmeth, and yet (I ſay) that to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in queſtion, hee hath fitted no other anſwer, than as if hee had anſwered, a poke full of plummes, or a Buchet full of Peares, (for the controverſie is not concerning thoſe that are without, but concerning thoſe that are within: not touching thoſe, that are not of the houſe-hold, but touching them that are of the houſe-hold of faith and of God.) As for the firſt ſort of which people, the Reverend Biſhops with good leave, may procure what ſharp puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they can deviſe, for by the Church excommunicated they ſhould never bee.</p>
                  <p>For how ſhould any be thruſt from the communion of the Church,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102527:75"/> who never were in the communion with the Church? But it is to bee feared, that this ſharpneſſe of puniſhment, is not urged ſo much to be inflicted upon them, that are without, as upon them, that are within the boſome of the Church. For though ſuch, as bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, did a long time ſcorne, and ſet naught by the ſword of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which was not onely drawne out, by the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ncelours, Commiſſaries, and Officials: for every cruſt of bread, and for every piece of Bacon, but alſo, which was againe put up, for every cracked grote, and for every <hi>IRISH</hi> harper; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Biſhops whoſe freehold by ſuch contempt, was not touched, were pacified, and contented themſelves well enough by inflcting, and releaſing that manner of puniſhment, but now for ſo much as they perceive the Children within the Church, to begin ſeriouſly, and religiouſly to ſtand againſt the uſe of Lordly and humane cenſures for the Crown and Scepter of our Saviour Chriſt, and that the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of Prelacy, muſt be taken one hole lower, if the ſimplicity of the holy miniſtery bee exalted a degree higher, they pretend Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline by excommunication, which is the ſword of the Son, and heire of God, to be too bluntly pointed, and too badly edged, to foyne, or to ſtrike withall.</p>
                  <p>Touching that very good manner of Diſcipline by the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall commiſſion, which hee ſaith hath done and doth daily much good, and would doe more, if it were more common, the people whom hee admoniſheth, have juſt cauſe of being deſirous to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what manner of Diſcipline it is, which is ſo highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <note place="margin">Not one manner of Diſcipline uſed by the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.</note> For all men know, that the Eccleſiaſticall Commiſſioners uſe not in all places, and at all times one and the ſelfe ſame manner of Diſcipline.

                  <p>Many other formes of eccleſiaſticall diſcipline of late yeares have beene uſed by the high commiſſioners: But whether they were all very good, and moderate diſciplines or no is greatly doubted, by many wiſe, learned, and godly men.

For ſaith the booke of Common prayer, the Diſcipline of the Primitive Church, is greatly to bee wiſhed. Ariſtocracie therefore, and the diſcipline of the Primitive Church, differing but in name, and not in nature, it cannot be hurtfull to the common weale, that the principles and reaſons thereof ſhould by experience be made familiar in the minds of the common people; nay it cannot but bee beneficiall unto the common weale, when the ſame ſhall underſtand, that the beſt obſervers of the law of God, and the beſt friends unto God and his people, are to be the Officers in the houſe of God. Neither is their whole drift, to be diſliked, but to bee commended, that labour to bring the government of the Church from a Papall Prelacie, to a Chriſtian Ariſtocracie: the one <hi>viz.</hi> Ariſtocracie, according to the interpritation of the name <note place="margin">Ariſtocracie in the Church o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptimatum, Praelacia peſſimatum poteſtas.</note> thereof, being <hi>optimatum poteſtas,</hi> a power of the beſt obſervers of the law; the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Prelacie, according to their practice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>peſſimatum poteſtas,</hi> a power of the worſt obſervers of the law: the firſt derived from the law of God, and practice of Gods people; the other reduced from the lawes and cuſtomes of the Gentiles and idolatrous Prieſts. And this of neceſſitie, in defence of the truth, the Admonitors argument, forceth me to ſpeake; for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102527:80"/> by an implication of the diſlike of bringing the government of the Churches by Paſtours and Elders, to a Democracie or Ariſtocracy, he hath by conſequence, diſclaimed and diſavowed the government of the Church by Prelacie, to be any of thoſe two. And what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther government then ſhould we thinke Prelacie to be, but either Oligarchie, or Tyrannie? For neither Monarchie may it be, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Prelacie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</note> Policie, or politicall eſtate can it be: and other kinde of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment beſides theſe there is not any. For my part, I more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably judge of the government of the Church by prelacie, than to match it with Tyrannie. And although the Admonitor, and the peruſers and allowers of his booke, were men in their generation wiſe, yet had they well weighed the nature of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Oligarchie, they would rather in this argument, have beene ſilent, than upon diſclaime of Democracie, and Ariſtocracie, (governments both of them commendable in their kind) have caſt the commendation of their owne government of the Church by Prelacie, to ſo deſperate an eſtate, as is the eſtate of Oligarchie. Wherein if any doe glory, becauſe not many of the beſt, but ſome few of the wealthieſt, and richeſt ſort doe governe, then let him hearken and conſider, what (long ſince) was preached before Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the fifth, by one <hi>Nicholas Orem,</hi> a man ſingularly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for learning in his time.

In the meane ſeaſon (after the faſhion of the Admonitors manner of admoniſhing the people, wee moſt humbly beſeech the King and Parliament to be enformed, that it is greatly to bee feared (if Prelacy bee Oligarchie) that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates <note place="margin">It is to bee feared leaſt (by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Prelates) Oligarchie be brought in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale</note> will endeavour, to transferre that manner of government, from the Church unto the Common-Weale.

For like as in good harmony (to make the Muſicke perfect) is required a moderate, and proportionate inequality of voices; which, if it too much exceed, taketh away all the ſweet melody, ſo by too much immoderate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, or diſparitie of Citizens, the Common-Weale falleth to ruine.

Indeed this queſtion, if it ſhould bee reſolved, by the Rules and Principles of the Canon Law, I could hardly diſprove that government to be Princelike: for, (as hath been ſaid before) <hi>quilibet Ordinarius in Diocoeſi, eſt major quolibet Principe.</hi> Yea and every Biſhop, by the ſame Law, hath as abſolute a ſpirituall power, within his Dioceſſe, as a King hath a temporall power within his Kingdome.

Only wee ſay that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church by Prelacy, cannot bee any kinde of Royall and Monarchiall government, becauſe Prelates have not like power ſpirituall, as Kings and Monarchs have power temporall.

Wherefore that the King, the Nobles, and Commons, may no more be feared, with the ſtrangeneſſe of theſe uncouth, and unknown Greeke names, of <hi>Democracy,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> written in his booke with great and Capitall Letters; I have thought it my duty, by theſe preſents to informe them, that the government of the Church by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and elders now wanting amongſt us, and deſired to bee brought into the Church, by the Soveraigne authority of our King, Nobles, and Commons in Parliament (for the outward forme and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof) is none other manner of Government, nor forme of policie, than ſuch as they, and their Progenitors and Anceſtors, for many hundred yeares together, without interruption have uſed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102527:82"/> and enjoyed in the Common-Weale.

For by the reaſons and principles of their owne govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Common-weale, and by the ſenſe, and feeling thereof, they may well bee induced, to thinke, that they have injury, if they have not as much to doe in matters of the Church, as they have to doe in matters of the Common-Weale, ſeeing they touch their commoditie and benefit ſpiritually, as the other doth temporally. And withall on the other ſide, I ſhall doe my beſt endeavour, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe them that the government of the Church by Prelacy, is ſuch a manner of Government, as was never yet in the adminiſtration of juſtice by any ſubject (no not touching the outward forme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) once admitted into any part of Common-Weale: and that therefore the ſame (if it may pleaſe the King) will very eaſily bee ſent, and tranſmarined unto <hi>Rome,</hi> whence it firſt came, and where it had it originall and birthright. And to the end, that wee may clearely diſcerne, whether the nature of the Government of the Church by Prelacy, or the nature of the Government, deſired to be planted by Paſtors and Elders, be more agreeable to the nature of the policy, received and uſed both by the Nobles, and common people, in the Common-Weale; it is neceſſary that the manners and formes, both of Prelaticall, and Paſtorall Government, bee made familiar unto the minde of the Reader.

I ſaid after a ſort, to this end, leaſt I ſhould bee miſtaken.

And therefore to hold us ſtill to the point in queſtion, it is very plaine and evident, that this manner of ſpirituall juſtice, mentioned to be executed, by the Paſtors and Elders, is more corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to the adminiſtration of civill juſtice, in the Common-Weale, than is that manner of the execution of ſpirituall Iuſtice, by Doctor <hi>Stanhope,</hi> or Doctor <hi>Ridley;</hi> by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> or by the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> For to begin with our meaneſt, and baſeſt Courts, let them ſhew unto us, any Court, Leete, Law-dayes, <note place="margin">Matters in Leets and Law dayes not overru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by one alone.</note> or Sheriffes turnes, within any County, City, Towne, Borough, Village, or Hamblet within the Realme, wherein matters of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill juſtice are heard, examined, and adjudged by one man alone. If for the common benefit of the Tenants againſt incrochments, over-laying of commons, waſt, nuiſances, or ſuch like, any paine is to bee offered, or preſentment made, the ſame is not ſet or made, by the Steward, Sheriffe, or other Officer alone, but by the common voyce and conſent of all the homagers, and ſutors to the Court. The Steward indeed is the director, and moderator of the Court, the giver of the charge, and the mouth of the whole Aſſembly, to pronounce and enact the whole worke of their meeting, but hee is not the onely inquiſitor, the preſenter, the informer, or the Judge, to diſpoſe all things according to his owne diſcretion. Beſides, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Kings peace, are not committed in any Countie, or other place within the Realme, onely to one Juſtice of the peace alone. For neither at the generall Seſſions of the peace, nor at any other leſſe publike meetings, any perſon, for any offence, <note place="margin">Breaches of the Kings peace, not puniſhable by one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> (whereof hee ſtandeth indighted, or for which hee is puniſhable) can bee fined, amerced, or bodily puniſhed, at the diſcretion of one Juſtice alone, but by the greateſt part of the Iuſtices aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, his penaltie is to bee impoſed upon him. Furthermore, this manner of the examination of the fact, and declaration of the Law, for the tryall of the fact, and judgement of the Law, doth not reſide in the breſt of one Iuror or Iudge alone. In the Court of the Kings Bench, if a Priſoner hee brought to the Barre, <note place="margin">Iuſtice in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the B.

Yea and in this Court, neither the interpretation of the common Law, nor the expoſition of any ſtatute dependeth upon the opinion, credit, or authority of one Iudge, or not of the Kings chiefe juſtice him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102527:84"/> alone; for his other three brethren and Co-juges; varying from him in point of law, may lawfully over-rule the Court.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102527:87"/> But becauſe this precept, was an article concluded upon by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Biſhops in their convocation, and confirmed (as I ſuppoſe) by the Royall authoritie of our late Queene, wee will forbeare, to ſpeake what we thinke, might juſtly be ſpoken, againſt the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie thereof. Only this without offence, to the reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, wee may ſafely demand: ſithence every ordinarie, whether he be a Biſhop, or a Presbyter, by this article of their owne device, hath ſuch an abſolute power, reſiant in his perſon, as that thereby, thorowout his whole juriſdiction, he may thus commit, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Diſcipline, by excommunication, partly to one lay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and partly to one eccleſiaſticall perſon, partly to a ſuppoſed ſpirituall elder, and partly to a Lay elder: ſithence (I ſay) this is ſo; we may ſafely demand, what reaſon they can produce, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King, from having authoritie to command three, or foure, <note place="margin">The K. hath as good right to command, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, to be exerciſed by a Paſtor &amp; Elders, as the Bb. have to commit the ſame to a Curate, &amp; one lay El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> or (if occaſion ſerve) five or ſix lay elders (as they call them) and one ſpirituall paſtor, being a true ſpirituall elder in deed, all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully choſen eccleſiaſticall Officers in the houſe of God, that they joyntly ſhould not execute the diſcipline of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and other cenſures of the Church, in every pariſh within his kingdome? If it bee anſwered, that in this caſe, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone doth excommunicate, is it not, as if one ſhould ſay, that the executioner doth give judgement when at the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Judge, he ſmiteth off the head, or caſteth downe the ladder? or may not as much be ſaid, for the execution whereof we ſpeak, that the Paſtor only ſhould excommunicate, when by vertue of his office, with the conſent, and not by the preſcript of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders aſſociated unto him, he ſhould declare and pronounce the partie to be excommunicated? but let it be granted that <hi>Rowland Allen,</hi> denounceth the leſſon which is written in the paper, for him to read; yet it is cleare by the precept, that the ſame muſt bee done, by the preſcript of Doctor <hi>Hone,</hi> Beſides Doctor <hi>Hone,</hi> he citeth, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizateth the parties, and they being abſent, hee pronounceth them <hi>contumaciter abſentes,</hi> and <hi>in poenam contumaciarum ſuarum hujuſmodi,</hi> decreeth them to bee excommunicate: and are not all theſe neceſſarie parts incident to the execution of diſcipline by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication? And how then can the Miniſter, bee ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate alone, when Doctor <hi>Hone</hi> of neceſſitie muſt play three parts of the foure; without all, or without any one of which parts, the excommunication by reaſon of a nullitie, is meerely voide? Againe, the Act being done, as it were <hi>uno puncto, ac uno halitu,</hi> and <hi>Rowland Allen,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Hone,</hi> having
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102527:88"/> their commiſſion from the Archdeacon, <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> how can their judgement be divided? Furthermore, to ſay that <hi>Rowland Allen</hi> doth excommunicate, by the authoritie of Doctor <hi>Hone,</hi> were to overthrow the intendment of the article: Becauſe by the ſcope of the article, it is plaine, that the presbyter, to be aſſociated to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, muſt only derive his authoritie from one who hath taken Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall orders. But thoſe orders Doctor <hi>Hone,</hi> never tooke, otherwiſe <hi>Rowland Allens</hi> preſence, had been unneceſſarie and ſuperfluous. And therefore if the excommunication bee of any vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, then is diſcipline, by excommunication in the Church of England exerciſed, partly by our lay-Elder (as they call him) and partly by one Eccleſiaſticall Elder; wherein againe, it is worthy the obſervation, for the matter we have in hand; that D. <hi>Hone,</hi> a meere lay and temporall man, hath authoritie from the Archdeacon, to call, and aſſociate unto him, and to preſcribe <hi>R. Allen</hi> a Presbyter, and an other mans hireling Curate in <hi>Southwarke,</hi> to excommunicate, not only the Parochians, of an other Paſtors charge, but any other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour whatſoever, ſubject to the Archdeacons juriſdiction. And hath not the Kings highneſſe then, as good right, as great a priviledge, and as high a Prerogative, to command Maſter Doctor <hi>Andros,</hi> or Maſter Doctor <hi>King,</hi> and lay Elders, by a lawfull election to be aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated unto either of them to excommunicate either of their owne pariſhioners, for publike drunkenneſſe, or other notorious ſinnes, committed in their owne pariſh? For if it be lawfull, at the voice of a lay ſtranger, that an hireling and ſtipendarie Curate, ſhould chaſe an other mans ſheep out of his owne fold, how much more is it it lawfull, that a true ſhephea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In every pariſh (ſaith the Injunction) three or foure diſcreet men, which tender Gods glory, and his true religion, ſhall bee appointed, by the Ordinaries, diligently to

And all ſuch as ſhall be negligent, in reſorting to the Church, having no great, or urgent cauſe of abſence, they ſhall ſtraightly call upon them, and after due admonition, if they amend not, they ſhall denounce them to the Ordinarie. Thus farre the injunction. Which, that it is not meant of the Church war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, appeareth by the very next article; for unto them, as is aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an other name, ſo alſo another office. That ſidemen alſo, are not theſe kinde of overſeers, is plaine, in that they be neither ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in number, as are here required, neither choſen by the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, neither yet doe they admoniſh and denounce, according to this article. Wherefore becauſe it is meet, that the effect of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction being religious, ſhould be put in due execution, it ſeemeth a thing very reaſonable, and much tending to the honour of the King, that his Highneſſe under his letters patents would bee pleaſed to appoint three, foure, or more diſcreet and faithfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in every Pariſh, not only to performe the effect of this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, but alſo generally to overſee the life and manners of the people, that without great and urgent cauſes they reſort not unto Typling-houſes, or houſes of evill note, and ſuſpected fame; and that upon the Sabbaths, they uſe no heatheniſh dancing, about their diſguiſed May-poles: And after due admonition if they amend not, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them to the Paſtor of the place. For then might the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor <note place="margin">Book of the form of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deining Prieſts.</note> be encouraged, to give his faithfull diligence, as at the time of his ordination, he ſolemnly promiſeth unto the Biſhop, alwaies to Miniſter the Doctrine and Sacraments, and Diſcipline of Chriſt, as the Lord hath commanded; by which words inſerted it the booke, there is a plaine and open confeſſion made by all eſtates in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Chriſt hath not only eſtabliſhed diſcipline, but a certaine forme of diſcipline in his Church, and that the paſtour to whom <note place="margin">Every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ought to miniſter the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſt in his owne cure, by conſent of Parliament.</note> the care, and charge is committed to teach the people, ought to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the ſame diſcipline. For it had beene a very abſurd part for the Parliament, to appoint the Biſhop, to receive a promiſe from the Miniſters, to miniſter the diſcipline of Chriſt, if Chriſt had not inſtituted a diſcipline; or that the ſame diſcipline, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, had not in their judgements belonged unto the Miniſter. And therefore this very letter of the booke convinceth the whole anſwer made unto the abſtract, touching this point to be very erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, frivolous and impertinent, to the point in queſtion: For whereas in the abſtract it is alleaged, that the Biſhop by vertue of

For the Parliament ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a religious conſideration, that the Miniſter of Chriſt, muſt not have ſo much reſpect, what the law of the Realme, as what the Law of God commandeth, carefully provided for his indemnitie in this behalfe.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, what a frivolous comment, hath he made upon the words of the booke, when he ſaith, that theſe words of the Biſhop, do not <note place="margin">A frivolous comment upon the words of the book of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of prieſts. &amp;c.</note> diſpoſitively ordaine any thing for diſcipline? When as the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not whether the Bb. words, but whether the law and booke diſpoſe any thing for diſcipline? For the Biſhop being but a ſervant to the booke, and to the law, and one unto whoſe fidelitie the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the law and booke is committed, though he doe not by his words, diſpoſe any thing of diſcipline; yet by his demand, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the Miniſter, that the office of the Miniſtration of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, within his cure and charge, is committed unto him, and that by his ordination, his perſon is fully enabled, as well to miniſter the Diſcipline, as to preach the doctrine of Chriſt. And hereupon alſo falleth to the ground, his other anſwer, as wholly impertinent to the point in queſtion. For where he ſaith, that the Law meant not, by

For there is no ſuch thing inſinuated, to be intended by the ſtatute: only the ſcope of the Authors drift, in that place ſeemeth to be this: <hi>viz.</hi> That every Miniſter, by vertue of his promiſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by act of Parliament, to be made by him, and by the office of miniſterie taken upon him, at the time of his ordination, hath bound himſelfe, to miniſter the doctrine, ſacraments and diſcipline of Chriſt, as the Lord hath commanded.

And ſuppoſe, I pray you, that neither this, nor any other law, had in particularitie, appointed the ceremonie of the Croſſe, the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Godfathers, or any other ceremonie in Baptiſme; or that the Law had not appointed the ceremonie of kneeling, or any other ceremonie, at the celebration of the Lords Supper, ſhould not the Miniſter therefore, miniſter neither Baptiſme, nor the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in the charge committed unto him? yes he ſhould.

Beſides, the anſwer ſhould be untrue, becauſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop at the time of his conſecration, doth not receive any authority to preach the Word, and miniſter the Sacraments; (for that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was then committed unto him, when firſt he was ordained to be a Presbyter:) But the authority which hee receiveth at the time of

For the proofe hereof we ſhall not need to ſearch any other authenticall record, then the precept, and the practice before intreated of. For it is not ſaid in the precept, that the Presbyter, being armed with authority from Chriſt, but it is ſaid, that the Presbyter, being armed with authority, from the Biſhop, or Archdeacon, ſhall denounce the ſentence of excommunication; the practice alſo of Doctor <hi>Hone,</hi> every way, confirmeth as much.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102527:93"/> their power ſo enlarged, as that thereby they may preach the Word, miniſter the Sacraments, and excommunicate: and that on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the little Paſtours, have their power by the inſtitution of their petie paſtorall offices, ſo ſtreitned, as whereby they may only preach the Word, and adminiſter the Sacraments, but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate: it behoveth (I ſay) great Paſtors, to bee able ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to ſhew unto us theſe things out of the holy Scriptures: or elſe it ſeemeth to ſtand, with reaſon and equity, deduced from the ſame Scriptures, that a Paſtor over a few, ſhould have like power to teach, and to governe a few, as a great Paſtor over many hath to inſtruct and to rule many. Marry, if they thinke, that onely great Paſtors bee true Paſtors, and that great powers ſpirituall, bee onely true powers ſpirituall; then let them alſo conclude, that onely great Knights be true Knights, that onely great Dukes be true Dukes, that onely great Kings be true Kings, and that onely great principalities temporall, bee true principalities temporall. Which concluſion if they ſhall judge, to be concluſionleſſe; becauſe King <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had <note place="margin">Not only Kings of great king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, but alſo Kings of ſmall kingdomes, bee true Kings.</note> as large a Patent, to feede, and to commmand two Tribes, as King <hi>Salomon</hi> his Father had to command, and to feede twelve; or as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> may ſuppoſe himſelfe to have, over nine or tenne Counties, as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> can have over nine and thirtie or fortie: then me thinketh it a matter, very reaſonably of them to be confeſſed, that all true Paſtors, whether they be great Paſtors, or little Paſtors, may lawfully exerciſe, all manner of ſuch true power ſpirituall, as unto true ſpirituall Paſtors by the holy Scriptures doth appertaine. For if Biſhops, being great Paſtors, may therefore preach, and miniſter the Sacraments, becauſe they be as they ſay, true Paſtors; then alſo may little Paſtors, therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, becauſe they bee, (as the Scripture ſaith) true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. Wherefore, if the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> by vertue of his Paſtorall office, (as he thinketh) which with his brethren the other Paſtors of his Dioceſſe, he hath in common deriveth unto him, immediately from the Word of God, may lawfully excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: then the Paſtorall office, which Maſter Doctor <hi>Andrews</hi> hath over the people of his Pariſh of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> without <hi>Creeplegate,</hi> and the Paſtorall function which Maſter Doctor <hi>White</hi> hath over the people of Saint <hi>Dunſtones</hi> within <hi>Temple-barre,</hi> being as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and as immediately, deduced unto them, out of the ſame word; what proofe can bee made out of the word, that the Biſhop being not Lord Paſtour of the Paſtours of his Dioceſſe, may lawfully by the word excommunicate, all manner of offenders both Paſtors
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102527:93"/> and people, within his Dioceſſe; and yet nevertheleſſe that neither Maſter Doctor <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and Maſter Doctor <hi>White,</hi> by the ſame word may excommunicate, any one of their Pariſhioners at all? Nay further, what reaſon can there bee afforded from the Law of God, that Maſter Doctor <hi>Abbot,</hi> Deane of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> that Maſter <hi>Browne,</hi> Maſter <hi>Barlow,</hi> and diverſe other Prebendaries, in the Church of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> having certaine parochiall, and Paſtorall Churches, annexed to his, and their Deanry, and Prebendes, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter D. <hi>Grey</hi> in his Pariſh by their paſtorall functions, ſhould have abſolute authority (unleſſe it bee during the time of the L.

For the Suffragan could not exerciſe any power called ſpirituall or Epiſcopall, unleſſe by the Biſhop hee were nominated, by the King elected and preſented, by the Archbiſhop conſecrated, and by commiſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Biſhops ſeale authorized, in what manner, and for what time he ſhould exerciſe the ſame. Cuſtom then being not from heaven, but from the earth; and again the Biſhops Commiſſion limiting the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraganes delegated power being of man, and not of God, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neceſſarily, that, that Epiſcopall power, which the Biſhops uſe and exerciſe in <hi>England,</hi> can not be divine but humane. Becauſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall authority which is divine, being conveyed from the Royall and Soveraigne authority of our Saviour Chriſt, the giver of all power unto every officer within his Ceurch, cannot bee transferred, to any other perſon, by the ſame Biſhop, by the King, by the body of the ſtate, or by cuſtome. For the Kings Perſon, and body of the ſtate, nor being made capable by the holy Scriptures, to uſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that Epiſcopall power which is of divine Inſtitution, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver transferre the ſame to others, whereof they bee themſelves unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.

                     <p>Wherefore ſeeing the Biſhop himſelfe, hath plucked certaine of his principall feathers from his own ſpirituall wings (if ſo be his own wings may be ſpirituall) and imped them with an untwyſted thread of humane policy, to the humane trayne of his Suffragane; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo his Archbiſhops grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in caſes of his metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politicall prerogative, the Archdeacons, <hi>London, Midleſex, Eſſex, Hertford,</hi> the Deane of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and certaine Prebendaries in <hi>Pauls,</hi> the Deane of <hi>Westminſter,</hi> the Maſter of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and diverſe other Perſons, have by Papall priviledges, or by ancient cuſtome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed almoſt all other parts of his Epiſcopall power; there ſeemeth good reaſon, that the Biſhop ſhould againe declare, whether the Churches within the ſaid Dioceſſe after the deceaſe, or tranſlation of his Lordſhip ſhall ſtand in need of any Lordly Succeſſor, to ſit in the ſame Sea, for any other profitable uſe or purpoſe, than only for wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a white rochet, walking with a paſtorall ſtaffe, keeping ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeares Sabboth, from preaching in his Pariſh Church at <hi>Fulham,</hi> conſecrating of Chappels, hallowing of Fontes, Chriſtening (as they call it) of Belles, whiting of Walles, painting of Tombes, garniſhing of Sepulchers, preſerving of ſuperſtitious Monuments in glaſſe Windowes, repairing and gilding rotten and outworne Croſſes, confirming Leaſes of Benefices, with cure of ſoules, upon ſmall rents, improprying Churches, or ſuch like. For if the great

                     <p>When I had thus finiſhed, according to our line, that which I firſt undertooke, againſt the Admonitors pre enſed dangerous alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, innovations, and inconveniences, and was alſo purpoſed, to have added that which (in mine opinion) ſeemeth to prove that, which the Admonitor by his opinion, denyeth; <hi>viz.</hi> that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall government of the Church ſhould alwayes, and in all places be one, when (I ſay) I had thus purpoſed, by reaſon of ſome other preſent, and for the time more neceſſary occaſion, I was driven to alter my minde, and to ſhew the ſame, in a place ſomewhat more convenient.</p>
                     <p>And yet in the meane while, it ſhall not be amiſſe, but a thing very neceſſary, in this place, ſo to cleare the ſtate of the queſtion betweene the Admonitor and me, as the ſame being rightly before hand underſtood, there might no prejudicate opinion be conceived againſt the truth.</p>
                     <p>The Admonitor againſt the not having one forme of externall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in all ages and ſtates of the Chutch, of Chriſt, alleadgeth that in <hi>Denmarke,</hi> they have Biſhops, both in name and in office: that in <hi>Saxony</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> office, but not in name: that in <hi>Tigure,</hi> they have no Senate of Elders; nor the diſcipline by excommunication, which they more miſlike, that in <hi>Geneva,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in other places, they have a government not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that platforme which is deſired to be among us: that in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> they kneele at the Lords Supper: all <hi>Tigure</hi> they ſit, and it is brought unto them, and that in other places they goe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, for the more expedition, as they paſſe. And that he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not but that the learned men, whom God ſent, to inſtruct thoſe Churches in which the Goſpell in thoſe dayes was firſt received, have bin directed by the ſpirit of God, to retaine this liberty, that in externall government, and other outward orders, they might chooſe ſuch, as they thought in wiſdome, and godlineſſe, to be moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, for the ſtate of their Countrey and diſpoſition of the people.</p>
                     <p>Vnto all which wee anſwer briefly; <hi>viz.</hi> that Biſhops both in name and in office being of divine inſtitution, ought as well to be in the Church of <hi>England</hi> as of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> that it is an errour (by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102527:96"/> their leave) in the Church of <hi>Saxony,</hi> not to have Arch. and Bb. in name, if ſo be they hold it lawfull to have Archb. and Biſhops in office. For what ſhould a neceſſary officer doe, without a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient name? And touching the Church of <hi>Tigure,</hi> it is not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, what the ſame Church doth thinke not tolerable, or doth more miſlike, but what ſhe ought not to miſlike, or what it ought not to think tolerable. And then what a poore proofe is there here made (trow we) for the confirmation of the corruptions in the Church of England by producing of two witneſſes, two errours in the Church of <hi>Tygure.</hi> For not to like a Senate of Elders, and more to miſlike excommunication, is more and more to ſlide out of the right way.</p>
                     <p>And ſithence we have the whole Chriſtian Kingdome of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the moſt famous, and renowned Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Churches, by his confeſſion in other places, to be lights unto us, and to agree with us, in a government not much unlike to that, which we deſire: wee have not onely great cauſe, to rejoyce in this our deſires, but alſo to be much comforted and encouraged, by theſe examples, by all holy meanes, to labour the full accompliſhment thereof. For by this teſtimony, and by theſe inſtances given and produced by himſelfe, the Admonitor hath quite and cleane weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and diſabled, his owne generall poſition, opinion, and thoughts of the unneceſſaries, and inconvenientneſſe, of having the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall and Primitive government, in the time of Peace, under a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>For hath not the free Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the free Citie of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and other Soveraigne and free Princes, Potentates and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, (not being under Tyrants, and perſecution) received the ſame, as being the beſt, the fitteſt, the convenienteſt, and moſt neceſſary government (yea even in the time of peace and under their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtracy) for the ſtate of their Countrye, and diſpoſition of their people?</p>
                     <p>And as touching rites and ceremonies, we affirme not, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rite, ceremony or circumſtance to be uſed in the externall execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church governement, is preciſely ſet downe in the holy Scriptures, but touching the ſubſtance of government, thus we ſay, and thus we hold: <hi>viz.</hi> that the Officers and Governours appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Saviour Chriſt, to be over the Churches in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey (obſerving the generall rules of decency, comelineſſe, and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) have liberty, with the conſent of their Chriſtian King, or other ſupreame Magiſtrate, to chooſe what rites and ceremonies,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102527:97"/> they in wiſdome and godlineſſe ſhall thinke moſt convenient. And therefore we grant that the officers of Chriſt, in the uſe and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of their functions, are no more exactly tyed, by any direct commandement in the holy Scriptures, to uſe at all times, and in all places, one only manner of rites and ceremonies than were the Prieſts of the Law, to uſe all one manner of knives, to kill their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, or the ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gers to ſing all ſongs after one manner of tune, or upon one kind of inſtrument, or then are Kings and Princes in all Countries commanded, to uſe all kind of circumſtances, in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward execution of civill juſtice in their Common-Weales.</p>
                     <p>As then, as it was lawfull for the Prieſts to have knives and trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of diverſe faſhions; and for the Levites to have their Muſicall inſtruments of diverſe formes: Nay as ſundry Juſtices of Peace, in ſundry Shires of the Kingdome, are not bound to keep their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seſſions, all in one day to begin, and to breake their Seſſions at one inſtant; to ſtand, to ſit, and to walke, whenſoever they ſpeake, to weare all one faſhion, hats, caps, cloakes, or gownes, and ſuch like: ſo likewiſe, is it with the Biſhops, Paſtors and Elders of the Church.</p>
                     <p>In the miniſtration of Baptiſme, there is no direct commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the veſſell to hold the water, for the Childes Baptiſme, ſhould bee of ſtone, of pewter, of braſſe, or of ſilver; whether the Miniſter ſhould deſcend to the lower end, or the child aſcend to the upper end of the Church: Whether the child ſhould have a great handfull, or a little ſponefull of water powred upon his head. In the celebration of the Lords Supper, it is directly commanded, that the people ſhall ſtand, fit, or paſſe: whether it ſhould be celebrated every firſt or ſecond Sabboth of the moneth; whether in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, at noone, or at night. In the ordination of Miniſters, there is no juſt proofe to be made, that any certaine number of Miniſters, are to lay on their hands, that the day of ordination ſhould bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one: that the Miniſter ſhould bee of ſuch an age, or that the prayers ſhould be of this or that length and forme of words. And therefore touching theſe and ſuch like things of indifferency, wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Admonitor and Reverend Biſhop that one ferme of externall orders, rites and ceremonies is not of neceſſity, to bee in every Church, becauſe there is no ſuch order witneſſed by the holy Scriptures to be of neceſſity. But touching the joynt, and ſeverall functions of Biſhops, Paſtours, and Elders, that they, or any of them, ſhould in any age or ſtate of the Church of Chriſt bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or that ſuch offices as by warrant of the Scripture are coupled
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102527:97"/> together, ſhould bee appointed, to execute any functions in the Church, then ſuch perſons onely, as for their functions, have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant from the holy Scriptures, wee cannot in any ſort thereunto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. And why? forſooth becauſe all, both offices, and Officers in the Church, muſt only, and alonely, bee derived from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, as from the only fountaine and beſtower of all officers, and offices in the Houſe of God. And therefore, albeit wee ſhould grant, (as the Admonitor hath ſaid) that the outward order uſed in the Primitive Church, touching rites and Ceremonies, by Biſhops, Paſtors and Elders, is neither neceſſary, nor ſo convenient as it may be otherwiſe, in the time of peace, and under a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, yet we may not hereupon imply, as his negative implyeth: <hi>viz.</hi> that Biſhops, Paſtors and Elders, or any of them, are neither neceſſary, nor ſo convenient officers, or governours, as other officers of mans invention might be. For which our opinion (by the help of God) we ſhall aſſay (as before hath beene mentioned) in an other place, to lay downe, out of the Word of God, ſome juſt proofes, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Admonitors requeſt) that there ought to be in all ages and ſtates of the Church, this outward order and forme of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>viz.</hi> that Biſhops, Paſtors and Elders, ought evermore to be ſpirituall governours, and that evermore they, and none other, ought to uſe that eſſentiall kinde of ſpirituall government, and none other which was practiſed by the Biſhops, Paſtors and Elders, in the Apoſtolicall and Primitive Church. Alwayes leaving the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rites and ceremonies of their ſpirituall kinde of governement, to bee indifferent, as erſt hath beene ſaid.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end I may enforme your Lordſhip of my dealing in this Parliament-time, againſt the undue claimed ſuperiority of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops over their inferior brethren, Thus it was,</p>
            <p>Becauſe I was in the Parliament time, in the 25. yeare of King Henry the eight. In which time, Firſt, all the Clergie, aſwell Biſhops as others, made an humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to King Henry the Eighth, acknowledging his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, and deteſting the uſurpation of the Biſhops of Romes authoritie. Vpon which ſubmſſion of the Clergie the King gave unto the ſaid Biſhops the ſame ample rule, that before they had under the Pope, over their inferiour brethren; ſaving that the ſame rule was abridged by ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by this parentheſis following, that is to ſay (without offending the prerogative Royall of the Crowne of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the lawes and cuſtomes of the Realme.) In the later end of the Statute, it was added, that whoſoever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth in any one part of that ſtatute, and their Aydors, Counſellors, and Abbettors, they did all fall into the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the premunire. And after I had recited this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in the Parliament houſe, I declared that in King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Eight dayes after this: There was no Biſhop that did practiſe ſuperio rity over their inferior brethren. And in King Edwards dayes, the ſaid Biſhops, obtained a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, whereby they were authorized to keepe their Courts in the Kings name: the which ſtatute was repealed in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, and was not received in her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
<pb facs="tcp:102527:99"/> time that now is, whereupon it was doubtfull to me, by what authority the Biſhops do keepe their Courts now in their owne names, becauſe it is againſt the Prerogative Royall of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> that any ſhould keepe a Court, without ſufficient warrant from the Crowne. Whereupon I was anſwered, that the Biſhops doe keepe their Courts now by preſcriptions, and it is true that the Biſhop may preſcribe, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. gave them authority, by the ſtatute of 25. of his raigne, to have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and rule over their inferior brethren, as ample as they had in the Popes time. But this was no ſpeciall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for them to keepe their Courts by, and that in their owne names. And yet they have none other warrant to keep their Courts (as they doe now in their owne names) to my knowledge. And this was the cauſe that made them obtaine a ſtatute in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, to keepe their Courts by, in the Kings name. Now, it is a ſtrange allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Biſhops ſhould claime authority at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to keep their Courts in their own names, (as they do) by preſcription, becauſe the ſtatute of 25. doth reſtraine them generally from offending of the Prerogative Royall of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and the Lawes and cuſtomes of the Realme. And no man may juſtly keepe a Court without a ſpeciall warrant from the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> as is aforeſaid. And the generall liberty given by King <hi>H.</hi> the 8. to the Biſhops to rule and governe, as they did in the Popes time, is no ſufficient warrant to the Biſhops to keep their owne Courts in their own names by preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I take it. And therefore the Biſhops had done wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they had ſought a warrant by ſtatute to keepe their Courts in the Queenes name, as the Bb. did in K. <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes: In which time Arch. <hi>Cranmer</hi> did cauſe <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> to come over into this Realme to be placed in the two Vniverſities, for the better inſtruction of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities in the word of God. And B. <hi>Cranmer</hi> did humbly prefer theſe learned men without any challenge to himſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:102527:99"/> of any ſuperior rule in this behalfe over his inferiour bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And the time hath bin, that no man could carry away any grant from the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> by generall words, but that hee muſt have ſpeciall words to carry the ſame by: Therefore how the B. are warranted to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the keeping of their Courts in their owne names, by preſcription: it paſſeth my underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Moreover, where as your Lordſhip ſaid unto mee, that the Biſhops have forſaken their claime of ſuperiority over their inferior brethren, (lately) to bee by Gods ordinance, and that now they doe only claime ſuperiority from her Majeſties ſupreme government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If this be true, then is it requiſite and neceſſary, that my L. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that now is, do recant and retract his ſaying in his book of the great volume againſt <hi>Cartwright,</hi> where he ſaith in plaine words (by the name of D. <hi>Whitgift)</hi> that the ſuperiority of B. is Gods owne inſtitution: Which ſaying doth impugne her Majeſties ſupreme government directly, and therefore it is to bee retracted plainly and truly. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> plainly and truly confeſſeth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 36. <hi>That his Kingdome was not of this world.</hi> And therefore he gave no worldly rule or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence to his Apoſtles, but the heavenly rule, which was to preach the Goſpell, ſaying: <hi>Ite, praedicate in omnem mundum, qnicun<expan>

But the Biſhops do cry out, ſaying, that <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his fellows, would have no government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So, belike, the B. care for no government, but for worldly and forcible go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over their brethren, the which <hi>Chriſt</hi> never gave to his Diſciples nor <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but made them ſubject to the rule of Princes, who ought not to be reſiſted, ſaving that they might anſwer unto Princes, that they muſt rather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God than men <hi>(Acts</hi> 5. 29.) and yet in no wiſe to reſiſt the Prince, but to take up the Croſſe and follow Chriſt.</p>
